    <h1>The games story</h1>
    <P>FF7 is one of my favorite games of al time, and with good reason! It has some beautiful game design
        and a really nice story. You play as a character called cloud strife, who was born and raised in a
        quiet little village called Nibelheim. To impress tifa, a girl nextdoor. He decides to go try out for
        soldier, wich is basiccaly the games version of the army. But he fails to join rank one soldier, and just
        turns into a basic infantryman. One day, cloud, zack, and the best soldier called sephiroth go out to inspect
        a broken reactor. Reactors are the games energy makers, pulling life out of the planet to turn it into energy.
        Sephiroth, while being there, discovers that he was not made like normal people. Instead, he was made using cells
        from some alien lady called Jenova. He goes absolutly crazy, setting Nibelheim on fire in the procces. He  almost kills
        cloud and zack, but they manage to survive. They get found by a scientist, and get locked up to get tested on. The scientist
        who fiends them is the same one who made sephiroth. They manage to escape, but zack gets killed in the procces. Cloud, having seen so much,
        goes crazy. He forgets all his times with zack, and instead invisions himself AS zack. Cloud now thinks that he was the rank 1 soldier, like zack.
        Tifa finds the now mindbroken cloud at a train station, and decides to take care of him. For more info,
        you'll need to play the game =D

<h1>My opinion</h1>
    <p>I have about 30 hours in FF7, and i enjoy it alot. It is probably my favorite game of all time, and i love all of it.
        The storyline is interesting, you get really in depth in the character story's. And its design is also really good,
        having a remake with in my opinion the best design i have ever seen. It is originaly a game from 1989, wich is verry impressive.
        making a game this beautiful, without a lot of design options is very good! It is nice to see this games community too,
        wich is still very lively to this day.

<h1>Iceberg</h1>
    <p>Final fantasy 7 has a lot of secrets, and a pretty big map. Some are easy, some are hard to find. But there are some secret summons that
        are also the best in the game, those too count as secrets. I will put a link to the video down in the website, so that is where you will find it.
        Again, i think final fantasy 7 is the best game ever released, its story revolutional. I will put a link to the iceberg too, they will tell you about
        all the secrets.
