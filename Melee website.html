    <h1>Characters</h1>
    <P>melee has a wide variaty of Characters, most of wich are kind of bad. The ones that have been outright dominating the meta are
        fox mccloud, falco, capton falcon and sheik. The tier list also has these characters on the highest rank, all are on S or B tier.
        In total there are 25 characters in the game, wich is much less than what you see today. But the characters arent what make melee
        so great, what really makes it shine is its movement.
    </P>
    <h1>movement</h1>
    <p>Melee really doesn't have a lot of stages, characters or modes. But what it does have is movement: wavedashing, dashdancing,
        wavelanding and shinedashing are a few of those tricks. There are a lot more, but these are the commonly used once. As soon as
        you get the movement under control, you will find this game verry interesting. in the bottom of the page i will put a link to some
        tutorials.

    <h1>players</h1>
    <p>Melee was always supposed to be a party game made for little kids. But when the community we now know found the tricks we talked
        about, they immediatly started grinding the game. Back when it began, it was played on mlg pro circuit. Back then, prize pools where
        pretty high, around â‚¬10,000 dollars where able to be claimed. This was when the first real god of the game came out in the open. His
        name was Ken, and there were no players that could beat him. At that time, he won nearly every match he played. After Evo 2010, Ken
        moved to the new game, called smash bros brawl. That left a new era of players the chance to go and dominate. The first of those gods
        was mew2king, who spent hours of his time grinding matchups and studying hitboxes. The second god was Mang0, he didn't spend time grinding.
        He just knew how to do combo's, and was willing to put a whole playstile around it. Nearly no one could stop mang0 in his prime, and he is 
        still going strong to this day. The third god was Armada, who at the time, was the best European player. He came to make a name for himself
        In the US. The fourth god was Hungrybox, who had a verry patient playstile. He would wait for his opponents to make a wrong move, and
        then he would strike. The last god was PPMD, who had a verry good playstile. He could effortlessly string together combos.
