    <p> Brief Note From the Editor: 

        . • The truth is, I hate RPG guide books. I 
        
        ■ y really do. It's all because of a terrible 
        
        y childhood trauma I suffered when I was 
        
        * "i\ carelessly flipping through my Phantasy 
        
        Star II guide booh and saw, hours before I 
        was supposed to, a picture of Palma 
        exploding. One of the best plot twists of 
        RPG history... ruined! Sure, after so many 
        . . ' years, the hurting has stopped, but the 
        
        scars have yet to fade away. 
        
        And that's not the least of their crimes. 
        Half the fun of RPG's is that whole feeling 
        of exploration, something that most guide 
        books crush in their tedious, point-by- 
        point, picture-by-picture series of instruc- 
        tions designed to get you through the 
        game as quicfely and with as little fun as 
        possible. What's the point of playing an RPG if a guide booh is going to 
        both ruin the storyline and destroy the feeling of exploration? You might 
        as well just pull out the ol' NES and pop in Lee Travino's Fighting Golf. 
        
        I've created this booh with these complaints in mind, and I'm proud of 
        the result. By giving each location in the game its own section, and high- 
        lighting the optional ones, the reader is free to open up the booh to what- 
        ever location they're at, and see all of that area's strategies, secrets, items 
        shop data and enemies without any heavy-handed instruction telling him 
        or her in what order the areas must be done. 
        
        I've also discovered it's perfectly possible to include every single secret 
        and strategy without giving away any of the plot. I certainly don't want to 
        have to carry the guilt of ruining any of FFVII's masterful storyline twists 
        for anyone... Heck, I feel bad enough for 
        
        ruining that part of Phantasy Star II for xiihii^^^^mhii^^Ki 
        you (at least I didn't tell you about Nei A| ■]', ■Sfcf B|\ *M 
        dying! Er... um... never mind). So you can /JL, Hlfi\l ^8v* 
        
        flip through this book secure in the knowl- ■£ :} jam*' "* Wm ^lC 
        
        edge that you're probably not going to see ^™ g vJw"* —WW 5 
        
        anything you'll come to regret. 
        
        As a result, this is a strategy guide that 1 "MB^* ''wi^f 
        
        even I approve of, and I'm not just saying 01 •# 
        
        that because they paid me to. Although, as 
        
        you can imagine, that certainly doesn't JL 
        hurt. *E ' |f* 
        
        Anyway, happy travels, and when the h i 
        
        quest is over, don't forget to drop me a line JL / 
        
        and let me know what you thought of the

        Before you dive into the walkthrough that begins on page 12, why not tafee a few minutes to flip through 
        this section and make sure you have a solid grasp of FFVII's fundamentals? Some of this may be covered in the man- 
        ual, but most of it isn't, and if you want to know how the Materia System, Battle System, and Limit Break System, real- 
        ly work, this is the place to look. This information is not covered anywhere else in the guide, and I'm willing to bet 
        that even the most experienced of Final Fantasy VII players have missed at least a few of these valuable tips...

        with a summon spell. Now let's say that the * 
        character with the spell is third in line. 
        Getting to him by having the first two char- {\ 
        acters attack would not only waste their \n 
        turns, it could also buy your enemies 
        enough time to launch attacks of their own. Go straight to 
        your summoner, and have him of her fry the enemies first. 
        Then the first two characters will still be fully charged, and 
        ready to finish off the survivors as soon as the spell is com- 
        pleted. 
        
        Remember that everyone's time bars (including your ene- 
        mies') are always filling up, so never waste a character's turn 
        in an urgent situation. For example, if your healer is about to 
        get her turn, your should ignore any characters who are 
        already ready to act, and wait for her. Select her with the A 
        button and have her cast the spell, then go back to the other 
        characters' turns... In the time it would have taken the other 
        characters to act, the member she was trying to heal could 
        have gotten killed. 
        
        There are other good uses for this tactic, too. If you're 
        fighting against weak enemies, you can use the A button to 
        ignore everyone else's turns and go straight to your weakest 
        character, allowing him to get the easy kill (The computer 
        does keep track of who gets "kills," and uses it as one of the 
        criteria to get new Limit Breaks. See that section for details). 
        
        There are a ton of uses for this option, so keep an eye out 
        for them. Once you get used to determining your own battle 
        order, you'll wonder how you ever did without. 
        
        • Handling Different Battle Types 
        
        There are four different kinds of battles that occur at ran- 
        dom. Usually, you'll merely be facing your foes, with them 
        facing you. But every now ' * "'M^ * ' 
        
        and then you'll get lucky and f, w, 
        
        come upon enemies with their '^^^^ 
        backs turned. This "pre-emp- 
        tive attack" formation allows " % \ 
        you to get the first shots in, ' * i» 
        
        and since your enemies have 
        
        4*X_The Completely Unauthorized Final Fantasy VII Ultimate Guide 
        
        
        
        this as soon as the battle 
        
        
        
        together to get your characters in 
        
        
        
        as wuii as 1.1c uamc motion . but , et go as soon as pos . 
        starts, and you'll never take sible to ensure that you won't acci- 
        the double damage! Of dentally run away. Now you can 
        course, you'll still be stuck in face soar attacfeers head on. 
        the back row, which means 
        
        your attacks will do less damage (see the section on Battle 
        Placement) until you "Change" to the forward row. 
        
        When the latter happens, and you're surrounded, your 
        strategy should be to pick the weakest side, and then do 
        whatever it takes to kill everyone on that side. Then you can 
        do the running trick outlined above to make sure everyone is 
        facing the remaining enemies. You may get beat around for 
        a few seconds, but you'll do much better than your foes 
        would in the same situation, since they don't seem to know 
        about the little running away trick... 
        
        • Running Away 
        
        Running away works the same on Final Fantasy VII as it did 
        in the Super Nintendo Final 
        Fantasy's. Just hold Ll and Rl 
        down, and your characters 
        will turn away from your ene- 
        mies and try to run. It may 
        take a while to work, so be 
        careful- while your backs are 
        
        
        
        turned, you'll be taking double damage, so you may want to 
        let go of the buttons for a second if you're anticipating taking 
        a very strong enemy attack. 
        
        The easiest way to run away is to start holding the buttons 
        as soon as the battle begins — the odds seem better that way, 
        and you can usually take advantage of the enemies' unpre- 
        paredness. 
        
        Are you penalized for running away? Well, the computer 
        does keep track of how many times you've run away (the old 
        man outside of Junon area can tell you the running tally), but 
        it doesn't effect anything, except for the amount of damage 
        you do with the Chocobuckle spell. So run away as often as 
        you feel you need to. 
        
        
        
        • Battle Placement 
        
        Using the Order command in the menu screen, or the 
        "Change" command in the battle menu (the effect of change 
        is not permanent) you can ., — 
        change where your characters S^ - **— 
        stand in relation to each other 
        
        and your opponents. The , 
        order in which you put them j, 
        doesn't matter, but their row |, 
        placement does. 
        
        Characters in the back row Whi i e beeping a weahling lifee 
        get attacked less often, and Yuffie in the back keeps her safe, 
        take about half the damage bear in mind that you're denying 
        when they do. When they her the opportunity to char ge her 
        
        , , . , limit gauge, and gain new levels or 
        
        attack, they do much less Iimit ^ fes . 
        
        damage, unless they have a 
        
        long range weapon like Vincent's, Yuffie's, and most of 
        Barret's. Magic is not effected by their row placement. 
        
        So basically, the back row is safer for characters, but does- 
        n't provide much of an opportunity for them to charge their 
        limit breaks. It also means that the characters in the front 
        row will be attacked that much more often. 
        
        
        
        esson 2: Limit Breaks 
        
        
        
        • How to Get New Limit Breaks 
        
        Getting new Limit Breaks may seems to happen complete- 
        ly at random, but it's actually anything but. There are only 
        two ways to get limit breaks: Either using old ones or killing 
        enemies. 
        
        For the first limit break of 
        each level, you must kill a set »A ^ 
        
        number of enemies. When I \ 
        say "you," I mean the charac- \^, ; 
        ter who you want to get the 
        limit break... If the killing blow .-^\ 
        (previous damage doesn't \ 
        
        matter) doesn't come from,,. , 
        
        ,' . „, Using old limit breahs is the only 
        
        that character, it 11 count as way to get to the new ones. If you 
        someone else's "kill." The ge t your first level 2 limit breah 
        magic number here is eighty, before you get your second level 1, 
        except for Vincent, who only don't switch over to level 2 quite 
        needs to kill sixty to advance a You , probably only need to 
        i . c- fit „«. * use your level 1 a few more times, 
        
        level. So kill that many ene- 
        mies to get your character his or her first level 2 limit break, 
        and kill another eighty to get their first level 3 limit break. 
        
        It's even simpler to get the second limit break of each level. 
        All you need to do is use the first limit break of that level 
        eight times. For example, you'll get Cloud's Cross Slash when 
        you use Braver eight time, and you'll get Climb Hazard when 
        you kill eighty enemies. As you can see, this means that 
        there's no set order for getting limit breaks, so make sure 
        that you come back for the ones you miss! 
        
        
        
        • Rigging the Limit Brea k Process 
        
        So now that you know BPBfW'***^ 
        where limit breaks come 
        
        from, you can rig the process ~" T ' r 
        
        to get them as quickly as pos- ' 
        sible. Obviously, the best way fjt 
        to get the former type of limit \, 
        break is to use that character 
        
        a lot in battle. In order to Areas with large groups of weafa- 
        ensure they'll hit the eighty lings, like the Mythril Mine, mabe 
        total as fast as possible, make racking up your 80 hills a snap, 
        sure whatever character you're trying to raise has a couple of 
        attack spells linked up to Enemy-All materia, or a summon 
        spell or two. The absolute best place to slaughter for ene- 
        mies is early in the game, in the Mythril Mine. The enemies 
        here are weak, and attack in large packs, ensuring plenty of 
        kills for all. 
        
        To get the second limit breaks quickly, you'll need to ensure 
        that the character gets hit enough to make them use their 
        limit break eight times. One great way to do this is to give 
        them the "Cover" materia, which will ensure that they take a 
        disproportionately large amount of the hits. Or, you can put 
        everyone else in the back row, where they'll be less likely to 
        be targeted. 
        
        But the best way to do it is to use hypers on all of your 
        characters, all of the time. As long as they're, uh, hyper, their 
        limit gauge will charge up twice as fast. True, they'll miss 
        their target a bit more often (that's a side effect of the anger 
        condition), but that's a small price to pay to get the limit 
        breaks early. 
        
        Oh, and since Cloud is the most powerful character in the 
        game, and must always be in your party, he'll get limit breaks 
        quicker than anyone else. Be aware of this, and make sure he 
        gives up most of his easy kills to the weaker characters, and 
        don't waste powerful, limit break-raising materia like 
        Counter Attack and Cover on him unless you really need to. 
        
        • Level 4 Limit Breaks 
        
        Cait Sith has only two limit breaks, and Vincent has four 
        (one for each level). Otherwise, every character in FFVII has 
        seven limit breaks, with two in levels 1-3, and one in level 4. 
        
        The level 4 limit breaks cannot be earned by killing ene- 
        mies. The level 4 limit breaks must be found, either by ful- 
        filling events, winning them as prizes, finding them in chests, 
        or receiving them from defeated bosses. They're items that 
        go in your inventory, with weird names like "Cosmo 
        Memory." You can use them at any time, but the character to 
        whom they belong won't be able to master the technique 
        unless that character has already mastered all six other limit 
        breaks, so you won't be able to use them right away. 
        
        One other note about limit breaks: It gets harder and hard- 
        er to charge each level, making level 3 & 4 limit breaks much 
        harder to charge than level 1 limit breaks. So if you try 
        equipping a level 1 limit break late in the game, it'll be 
        charged in only a few hits. You might actually want to try 
        this, as old limit breaks do get more powerful as your char- 
        acter goes up levels, and many will hit the 9999 barrier that is 
        the maximum amount of damage a single hit can do! 
        
        • Raising Your Characters 
        
        Obviously, you'll get both types of limit breaks much 
        faster if you use the same three characters throughout the 
        game. So... should you? I like to rotate my characters just 
        for variety, but if you're more concerned about winning, 
        there are benefits to that strategy. 
        
        lust keep in mind that you will be required to play every 
        character (except for Vincent) at various points in the game, 
        so you may run into trouble if that character is ridiculously 
        weak. Inactive characters do get 50% of the experience that 
        active characters get, but they can't get limit breaks that way.

        Lesson 3: Raising Materia 
        
        • Raising Your Materia 
        
        The basics of the materia system are explained through the 
        game's own manual and tutorials, but I wanted to give you a 
        few additional usage tips. 
        
        The first is to be careful about how you raise your materia. 
        The benefits of getting your materia to attain higher levels is 
        unquestionable, but it effects some materia far more than 
        others. As you start getting double AP and even triple AP 
        armor and weapons, you'll need to make sure you fill them 
        with the right materia to maximize your magical power. 
        
        Green (Magic) materia benefits the most from going up 
        levels, as it yields you new spells. Purple (Independent) 
        materia often increases in power and magnitude as it goes up 
        levels as well. Some Blue (Support) materia increases in 
        power, but the benefits are usually slight. For example, it's 
        rare that you'll use any Enemy-AU'd materia more then two 
        or three times in a fight, so it doesn't really matter if it's level 
        3 (3 uses), 4 (4 uses), or Master level (5 uses). A few yellow 
        materia yield new abilities as they go up levels, but most 
        don't. Enemy Skills can't go up levels at all. 
        
        Summon materia are pretty much the worst. Each has five 
        levels, which effects how many times it can be used in battle, 
        but once again it's highly unlikely that you'd be using them in 
        any one battle more than once. 
        
        Materia reproduces itself when it achieves the Master 
        level, which can be nice some times... It's always good to have 
        another Enemy-All around, I suppose. But most materia can 
        simply be bought if you want more, and it's unlikely that 
        you'd want duplicates of many of them, so you may want to 
        rotate them out of the high-yield materia slots after they get 
        their highest level spells and abilities. 
        
        My main point is simply to be consciously aware of which 
        materia you're favoring as you equip them... They gain AP 
        slowly, but it does add up, and it's a shame to waste it on 
        materia don't have much room to grow. 
        
        • Sense Materia 
        
        Here's a little trick most people don't know about that 
        makes Sense Materia a bit more useful. Once you use this 
        Materia once to find out an enemy's HP total, you need never 
        do it again.. .You can check his HP total again, whenever you 
        want, by simply pressing select and targeting him! Pretty 
        cool, eh? 
        
        • Enemy Skills Materia 
        
        The Enemy Skills Materia is quite different from other 
        materia. It doesn't gain AP, and has no apparent use at first. 
        The magic it casts can only be gained by having enemies cast 
        it on you first. 
        
        Your first opportunity to use it is just outside of Midgar, 
        where you can learn "Matra Magic" from Custom Sweeper 
        enemies. This spell targets everyone, so whoever has Enemy 
        Skills equipped (yes, you have to have it equipped) will auto- 
        matically learn the spell. You'll have to be more careful with 
        later magic, though, to ensure that it targets the character 
        who's holding the materia. Some enemy skills are never cast 
        by the enemies who are capable of them, so you'll have to 
        make them do it with the Manipulate Materia. 
        
        While this Materia seems to be a waste of space at first, it's 
        >* w ^i^^Qm the only way to learn a num- 
        k\ ber of incredibly powerful 
        
        ifcjL * • fl» spells, and has the very big 
        
        •C. r> advantage of allowing one 
        
        ^fltv'' character to cast a wide vari- 
        
        ' ety of spells while only taking 
        
        i, ii^H^ ' one materia slot. Oh, and just 
        
        Once these guys hit you with in case you were curious, 
        magic, it's yours forever. 
        
        6^l(The Completely Unauthorized Final Fantasy VII Ultimate Guide 
        
        
        
        when you "master" Enemy Skills, defined as gaining all 24 
        skills (this is very difficult), it won't reproduce itself. But you 
        can get up to three Enemy Skills materia in the game, and you 
        can always "copy" spells between them by simply having the 
        character with the full Enemy Skills Materia cast them on 
        whoever is holding the empty one. A list of all 24 enemy 
        skills is on page 141. 
        
        • Manipulate Materia 
        
        The Manipulate Materia is a""^^ 
        invaluable when used in con- 
        junction with Enemy Skills _^ « 
        Materia, as it allows you to WMk^£_^^T A 
        force enemies to cast their ^I Bw B' <2gs 
        hard-to-get skills. It can also ^jjjlf^R* 
        
        When you "manipulate" an Manipulated enemies turn blue 
        enemy, you have access to all and H 'P to face the otner wa ?- 
        of its attacks and skills. You basically decide what he does on 
        all of his turns, whenever one comes around. The catch is 
        that it doesn't always work, and the controller loses all of his 
        turns until the control lock is broken. 
        
        It won't work on bosses, but many strong, single enemies 
        can be controlled. You can make the enemy destroy himself, 
        or destroy his friends. Your allies can kill him with magic 
        while he is unable to defend himself, but be forewarned that 
        if you ever hit with a regular hit, you'll lose control of him. 
        Still, you should also keep in mind that since Manipulate 
        turns the enemy around, that regular hit will do extra dam- 
        age, and just might be worth it after all. 
        
        • Morph Materia 
        
        The last materia I'll explain mi 
        about in detail (I talk about all I 
        the rest in Appendix D) is ' 
        Morph. I'll give it to you f\ r 
        straight here... This one pretty r 
        much sucks. When equipped L 
        and selected in battle, it 
        
        makes its wearer do a special These Cactuers (p.73) are" one of 
        regular attack that does only the few enemies who turn into 
        1/8 the damage of their Stan- something good when Morphed. 
        dard attack, if this attack end up being the killing blow, the 
        enemy will "morph into" some sort of item, which is listed 
        alongside the enemy in the enemy boxes. There are a few 
        treasures to be gained this way, but not many. 
        
        Lesson 2: Magic "Types" 
        
        • Magical Types and Weaknesses 
        
        Often in this book you'll see me refer to so-and-so- type 
        magic, or "type-less" magic. This is a very important and fre- 
        quently overlooked aspect of Final Fantasy VII's battle sys- 
        tem, and it's worth taking the time to understand. 
        
        If I smack a monster with my sword, I do type-less damage 
        to him. If I cast a Fire 1 spell on him, I do Fire-type magic to 
        him. If I use the Elemental materia to attach Fire to my 
        sword, then my sword will also do Fire-type magic. It's sim- 
        ple, but important. , „ ^^""'■M 
        
        There are many different » flt 
        
        types of magic, as explained jt^ Mt^A^tt IBr 1 !

        always hate lightning, and anything that flies is at the mercy 
        of the wind. If you guess wrong, it's usually no big deal, 
        unless they're protected from that type of magic. 
        
        Protection from magic means that it does no damage to a 
        single target, or a very small amount. If they're able to 
        absorb it, that's even worse- all the damage you would have 
        done to them ends up refilling their life! Some enemies have 
        protection from all types of magic, which is when type-less 
        magic, like the Enemy Skill "????" spell and Bahamut come in 
        handy. AH the power of magic, but there's no way to negate 
        the damage. 
        
        By using certain armors, certain accessories, and materia 
        like Elemental, you're able to give yourself protection and 
        absorption abilities towards different types of magic. You 
        can check these out on the second page of the status screen. 
        
        • Magical Conditions 
        
        "Conditions" is the blanket term for any spell applied to 
        one of your characters that doesn't immediately go away, like 
        if you're put to sleep, turned into a frog, or angered. Some

        The percentages are taken from the total number of enemies with a 
        weakness, and with a protection, respectively. Meaning, if there's an 
        enemy with a weakness, it's going to be lighting 20.2% of the time. 
        Gravity got very high scores for enemy protection because most boss- 
        es and large enemies are immune, while Earth got its high score due to 
        the fact that everything that flies is immune to Earth magic. As you can 
        see. Earth is probably the lamest of all the magic types, as few enemies 
        are weak to it, but many are protected. Wind is the best, but since 
        there are so few powerful sources of wind damage, that's very difficult 
        to exploit. Lightning is your 2nd best bet. 
        
        opponents, through a vast number of green materia and 
        skills. You can even use Added Effect to attach one to your 
        weapon! Personally, however, I find most of them useless, as 
        bosses tend to be immune and they're not worth the trouble 
        against regular enemies. There are a few exceptions... 
        Shockingly, "Stop" works on some bosses, and poison comes

        ow to Use This Guide 
        
        
        
        Upon first seeing the format used in this booh, you will no doubt consider it to be a horrendously gaudy and unnecessari- 
        ly confusing mess. But I guarantee that after reading this page and spending a few minutes familiarizing yourself with the 
        book's contents, you will come to feel that this booh is actually a horrendously gaudy and unnecessarily confusing mess 
        from which it is technically possible to extract small kernels of useful information. And I stand by that guarantee 100%. 
        Well, maybe it's more like 90% or, even in the mid-80% level. But still, I do standby it somewhat. 
        
        Here we have a typical page of this guidebook... Kind of a mess isn't it? Yep, just to complicate your life, I've included a ton 
        of weird systems in each and every page. I'll do my best to guide you through them. 
        
        Location Tabs: Okay, up here we have the name of the area this page covers. This page covers two separate areas. Gold* 
        Saucer Area, and Gongaga. Note the difference in color: Gongaga is bluish because it's an optional quest. You do have to 
        go through the Gold Saucer Area to progress in the quest, but whether or not you stop off in Gongaga is up to you. 
        
        Facts-At-A-GIance Box: This is where you should start each page. It features both a game screenshot of the area, and a map 
        that illustrates its location relative to where you're coming from, and where you have to go next. In between is a step-by- 
        step list of the objectives you have to meet in this area. Once again, the bluish ones are optional. Below is a list of all the* 
        stuff you can get on this page. Items are in black, materia is in white, and enemy skills are in blue. Items in red are items 
        that must be stolen from enemies. The enemy skills and stealable items should correspond to the same information in the 
        enemy boxes below. 
        
        Enemy Boxes: All of the enemies you can encounter in this area are listed here, along with their amount of Hit Points and 
        Magic Points, weaknesses (if applicable), and how many Experience and Ability Points you get for killing them. Below that 
        is a list of the items they may drop, the items you can steal, what they'll change into if you hit them with the Morph mate- 
        ria, and what learnable enemy skills they know. 
        
        Miscellaneous Text: These text boxes usually elaborate on the step-by-step objectives listed at the top of the page, but many 
        of them also present new information, such as how exactly to get the Aqualung enemy skill. If there's anything at all inter- 
        esting going on in the area, this is where I'll let you know. Light colored boxes usually list the more mundane tips, where- 
        as the really cool secret stuff is revealed in the dark boxes. 
        
        Boss Strategies: These dark boxes contain strategies you might want to try against the bosses you'll encounter in this area._ 
        Or at least they're supposed to. This one sure doesn't tell you much of anything. 
        
        Shop Data: Near the map of Gongaga town is a list of all the items you can purchase there. Once again, materia is in white.s 
        You'll get used to it eventually. Probably. 
        
        
        
        Ah, but the fun doesn't end there! In the handy appendices that follow the strategy guides you'll find all sorts of 
        crazy charts and boxes. I'll run through a typical item box and materia box here.

        pre-meteor (disc 1) part of the game, or in Costa Del Sol 
        afterwards, or you can find it in the Shinra Building. j

        Fantasy VII overworld map. Everything has been drawn to scale 
        by Lena Yoshibawa's expert hand, and every major game location 
        has been marked. Please note the difference between the light 
        blue shallow water and the blue, darker water: The light blue 
        water can be traversed by the Tiny Bronco, but it will take a Sea 
        Chocobo (or the Highwind) to cross the deeper blue ocean.

        When you first get off the train, don't forget to search the corpse 
        of the first dead guard for two potions. Not a bad start! 
        
        This first dungeon probably won't I 
        give you too much difficulty. The path 
        is completely linear, so you won't j 
        even need a map (don't bother stray- 
        ing from the trail to search for items... J 
        Except for the Phoenix Down in the ■ 
        one chest here, there aren't any). 
        
        There are a few tricky enemies I 
        here, but luckily Cloud co mes pre- 
        equipped with Bolt magic, 
        
        
        
        
        Not only 
        - to unlock 
        
        
        
        is it 
        the 
        
        
        
        which is a weakness nearly 
        all of the enemies in this 
        area share. Save it for the 
        Sweepers, whom it can kill 
        in only one blast. If you're 
        running out of MP, save it 
        for the way out, because 
        when the bomb starts tick- 
        ing, you won't be able to 
        afford long, drawn-out bat- 
        tles. Finally, make sure you 
        save Jessie on your way 
        the right thing to do, you'll also need 
        doors on the way out!

        any major differences in the long run, but Tifa, Aerith, Yuffie (and maybe even Barret) have a hidden attribute that indi- 
        cates how much they like you. This attribute's most direct bearing on the game comes into play on the date scene on page 
        55, so if you want to date Yuffie or (ugh) Barret instead, you better start making Tifa and Aerith hate you now. But if you 
        want to be a nice guy, you can tell Aerith when you meet that nothing happened, and then comment on her flowers. She'll 
        sell you one for a buck, getting you your first "love point" with her. You can then get a point from Tifa by giving her the 
        flower, you two-timer, you. 
        
        
        
        
        
        Your first stop in the slums should be 7th Heaven, 
        where you can give Tifa that flower you bought (no 
        point wasting it on Marlene!). After that, get some 
        rest and some money- yo u'll need both before your 
        next assignment.

        You'll also learn how to 
        use materia here, so don't 
        forget to equip your 
        Restore materia, and to 
        stock up at the local | 
        shops. You can also get 
        your first Enemy-All 
        Materia in the Beginner's 
        Room on the 2nd floor of 
        the lower right hand 
        building... If you want to play it safe, you can 
        stick that onto Restore, but your best bet is 
        to use it with lightning... That'll be the weak- 
        ness of the majority of enemies on the next 
        mission, too. 
        
        
        
        
        Gadzooks! Something's gone horribly wrong during the ID 
        scan, and now you have only 15 seconds to get out of each 
        train car and into the next one. Failure to do so will result in 
        your having to jump from the train far away from your even- 
        tual destination. But you still have a few seconds per car to 
        talk to the locals... and pick up a few free items! The bum on 
        the top screen has a Phoenix Down he won't mind parting 
        with, and the guy right up front in the second car (middle 
        shot) has a Hi-Potion. But watch out for pickpockets in car 
        3. If they rip you off (100 gil), you can get your money back 
        by following them to wherever they go, and talking to them 
        repeatedly. 
        
        Once you jump from the train, you'll only have to run a little 
        ways into the screen (depending on which car you jumped 
        from) to get to the entrance to the Sector 4 Plate. But what 
        if you run towards the screen? Eventually you'll get to a 
        guard bank where you'll have to ■ 
        fight Special Combatants over 
        and over until you decide to run 
        away. It's a good place to rack up 
        on XP and grenades, but you'll 
        have to take my word for it when 
        I tell you that ultimately there's 
        no way to win and get inside.

        The Sector 4 Plate is pretty straightforward (all the lad- 
        ders lead to the same place), but you'll have to do the 
        5th Reactor in the right order to proceed. 
        
        First, take route 1-3 to set 
        the bomb, and then retrace 
        your steps back up to route 
        4. To open that door, you'll 
        all need to press the buttons 
        (left) at the same time... Wait 
        for about two seconds after 
        Tifa's text box clears before 
        you hit your switch. 
        
        The enemies here can be 
        tough, so make sure you 
        have an Enemy-AH-equipped 
        Lightning so you can off 
        those nasty 5-packs of Proto 
        Machineguns before they 
        shoot! 
        
        Finally, before you go 
        through that last door (#5) 
        make sure you're all healed 
        and ready for a fight... The 
        Shinra corporation has a few 
        surprises waiting for you.

        why not take the opportunity to show Aerith just 
        how incredibly cool you are? Tell her to hold on 
        a minute, and then bill the oncoming guards with 
        the barrels stacked in the rafters. Push the left 
        barrel, then the top barrel, then the right barrel,

        and the enemies you'll 
        encounter, especially in Sector 6, 
        can be incredibly difficult. 
        Luckily, the route is short, so you 
        can afford to use offensive magic 
        continuously, and use the 
        Restore Materia to heal yourself

        Is that... Tifa? Sure looks like it, so you're gonna have to abandon your plans of returning to | 
        Sector 7 and head into Wall Market to investigate. After you've explored and done your shop- 
        ping, head on over to the Honey Bee Inn that's just past the southwest exit of Wall Market's | 
        lower half. Ask the bouncer about Tifa, and he'll refer you to Don 
        Corneo's mansion, which is just north of Wall Market's top half. Talk to his 
        bouncer, and then confer with Aerith... She has a plan, and you're not 
        gonna like it. Yep, the on ly way in is for poor Cloud to dress up as a 
        woman and sneak past with Aerith's help. 
        
        7 need to get a dress and a wig to 
        get past the guard, but damn it, if 
        you're going to do something, you 
        might as well do it right. So put 
        the kids to bed and close the

        To get your dress, ask at the dress shop, 
        where the clerk will send you to talk with 
        the dress-maker at the bar in the middle 
        left of the top half of Wall Market. Which 
        dress you get depends on how you answer 
        his questions: "soft" and "shimmers" gets 
        you the Silk Dress (the best), "soft" and 
        "shiny" gets you a Satin Dress, choosing 
        "clean" gets you a Cotton Dress. Head 
        back to the dress shop to pick it up. 
        
        
        
        The dress shop owners will set up the 
        wig for you... Head to the health club in 
        the lower part of the top map, where 
        [ you'll have to beat one of the patrons at 
        Squats (go slow and steady to win, since 
        the time penalty for messing up is fairly 
        serious) to get it. If you win, you get the 
        Blonde Wig, if you tie or lose you get the 
        Dyed Wig or just plain Wig, respectively. 
        
        
        
        Eat at the restaurant near the top of the 
        lower half of Wall Market. Order what- 
        ever and then tell the cook it was "okay." 
        Get your free Pharmacy Coupon and 
        trade it in (at the pharmacy), for an 
        Extinguisher (Sexy Cologne, the best). 
        Deodorant (Flower Cologne), or 
        Disinfectant (Cologne). Give your item 
        to the girl in the bathroom of the bar, and 
        j she'll give you the cologne. 
        
        
        
        
        Talk to this guy to get a 
        Member's Card for the Honey 
        Bee Inn. Head on in and par- 
        ticipate in either of the rooms 
        (listed below), and you'll get 
        Bikini Briefs (bottom room) 
        or Lingerie (top room). You 
        must talk to the bee girl in 
        your room after the event to 
        get the lingerie.

        r-~t.it t T 
        
        
        
        Talk to the guy in the northernmost store 
        of the lower half of the map. He'll send 
        you to stay at the inn, and get him an item 
        from the vending machine at the middle 
        of the night. When you bring it back to 
        him, you'll get a Diamond Tiara if you 
        bought the most expensive item, a Ruby 
        Tiara for the middle-priced one, and a 
        Glass Tiara if it was the cheapest one. 
        
        
        
        I Once you have all of your items, go to the dress shop to change, 
        | and then head bach to Corneo's mansion, where you'll finally be 
        allowed in. Find Tifa in the basement, then all of you can go face 
        Corneo together. He'll pick his one companion for the night, and 
        the other two will be thrown to his I 
        henchmen to entertain them. If 
        you're picked (you will be if you have 
        enough points, based on the quality I 
        I of your costume), you'll get to mess I 
        with his mind for a bit before the others come rushing in. If 
        you're not piched, you'll have to fight his henchmen (there's a | 
        Phoenix Down in one of their rooms) and then come to the res- 
        cue of whoever was piched. There's a free Hyper behind his bed.

        The big excitement here in 
        the sewers is the Steal 
        Materia, one of the most 
        useful items in the game. 
        While most enemies just 
        give you crap like potions 
        and tranquilizers, there 
        I are a couple of enemies in 
        every area that are carrying weapons or armor that 
        won't be available for sale until many game hours 
        later (if at all!). Case in point: The rare trainyard 
        enemy Eligor. If you come across him, let him work 
        you over for as long as you can stand until you can 
        successfully steal Aerith a , 
        Striking Staff. She 
        won't be able to buy j 
        that powerful [ 
        
        weapon for at least I 
        five or ten more [ 
        game hours. 
        
        You'll need to hop into the two brown-colored

        And while you're visiting the Wall Market, why not check up on your old friend Don 
        Corneo? Unfortunately, he's long gone (don't worry, you'll meet again), but you can 
        set free one of his subordinates from the rack in the basement. You don't get anything 
        . for doing this, just good karma, I 
        suppose. Oh, and speaking of his 
        subordinates, you can now visit 
        their room and pick up the 
        Phoenix Down that you missed if 
        Cloud was the one who Corneo 
        picked to be his companion for 
        the night.

        Be careful here... Reno's not so 
        tough in terms of damage-deal- 
        ing capability, but his pyramids 
        are deceptively deadly. As soon 
        as a character gets trapped by 
        one, he or she's out of combat 'til 
        another character can bail them 
        out (just choose attack and 
        select the pyramid as the tar- 
        get). Don't procrastinate, cause 
        if he can get them on all three of

        There's only one route to 
        the Shinra Building, and 
        that's to scale the wall of 
        pipes, cables and garbage in 
        the northeast corner of the 
        Wall Market. But you won't 
        be able to make it without a 
        little help, so you'll need to 
        talk to the people collecting 
        garbage in the upper half of 
        Wall Market, who will direct 
        you to the man on the left 
        side of the weapon shop. 
        For three hundred bucks, 
        he'll sell you the three bat- 
        teries you need to power 
        the various broken contrap- 
        tions strewn about on your 
        way up, opening up the 
        route for you. 
        
        
        
        
        And then just set them in the slots to 
        activate the machinery. 
        
        
        
        
        I guess it's not really that 
        important, but if you 
        think about it, there real- 
        ly aren't that many words 
        in English that begin with 
        "A-v-e-r-I." Actually, 
        according to the dictio- 
        nary, there aren't any. 
        Want to know what I 
        think they were aiming 
        for here? "Averlanche." 
        Seriously. 
        
        
        
        Using a battery here is not neces- 
        sary... It just gets you an ether.

        The big question here is, "straight through the ] 
        or around back and up the stairs?" The stairs are 1 
        and boring, and the only thing up there is an elixir, but 
        there are no enemies. If you go through the front, 
        you'll find a 2nd Turtle's Paradise Inn ad, a shop, an 
        FMV clip advertising Shinra's fine line of automobiles, 
        and have a first crack at stealing some cool stuff from 
        some relatively tough ene- 
        mies. 
        
        The answer? Well, if I 
        you're playing the game 
        with the goal of getting everything, the answer is "both." Yep, 
        forty hours from now you'll be denied the chance to get a 
        mediocre weapon for Red-XIII (but one that's unavailable 
        anywhere else) if you didn't run all the way 
        
        up the stairs, grab the elixir, and then run all the way back down 
        again and go in the front. Have a nice hike! 
        
        Here's that second Turtle's 
        Paradise Inn ad, right on Shinra's 
        1st floor message board. If you 
        took the stairs, make sure you 
        come back for it! 
        
        
        
        
        It kinda looks like a bank of

        Shinra co. gift shop. They only 
        sell regular item shop staples, but | 
        the FMV sequence you get if you 
        check out the monitor makes it 
        well worth the trip.

        mabe sure that when they do, you're not within '

        I be careful, if you screw up either time you'll be

        from here, you'll need to get Key Card 62 from the 
        grey-suited power-walber who tends to hang 
        around in the lower right-hand corner of the 
        room. Don't asb him about Aerith, let him

        building most exclusive floors, if you'll 
        I answer a little riddle for him (and you thought your 
        | company had security problems!) 
        
        Sure, I'd love to just tell you the solution and ruin it for 
        I you, but the puzzle is actually random. To solve it you'll 
        I need to (!!!Don't read past here if you don't want it 
        ruined!!!) investigate the four library rooms, find the one 
        boob that's mis-filed (ie, doesn't fit the description on the 
        door), and then memorize whatever letter matches the 
        number before the title. For example, if the boob is titled 
        Ether » 16 pj na i Fantasy VII Ultimate Guide" you would remem- 
        Potion ber the letter "U," and that would be one of the four letters IS" 
        lothing- in the password (the order isn't important). Repeat for IS 
        each library section. 
        If you get it on the first try, you'll get the Elemental Materia... A decent prize, 
        but something you might not want to waste a materia slot on (if you do use it, hoob 
        it to Lightning). See the Materia section for tips on usage.

        Oops... Here's a tip for those new

        Meaning that now would be a 
        very bad opportunity to try out

        because you'll only end up heal- 
        ing this guy. Concentrate on

        fight a boss by himself, and Aerith, Barret, and Red-XIII will 
        have to fight two in a row once they get on that 69th floor 
        elevator. Tifa won't be doing much of anything, so give her 
        Materia to the people who will have bosses... But make sure

        fight the big boss at the end of the cool (and easy) bike-rac- 
        ing mini game, or she'll be a big 
        hunk of dead weight when you're 
        going to be needing a strong

        Welcome to the outside world! Kalm is just a little ways ^ 
        to the Northeast, but why not enjoy the charms of the 
        Midgar area first? I'm referring specifically to the 
        goody-dispensing Custom Sweeper "enemies." These I 
        rare finds not only have a powerful new weapon for 
        Barret (far better than the one you can buy at Kalm) I 
        waiting to be stolen, they'll also teach you your first | 
        enemy skill. If you manage to come across a pair, do whatever you have to do to beep 
        them alive until they cast Matra Magic on your party. Since this spell targets everyone, it 
        will automatically hit the party member who has the Enemy Skills materia equipped 
        (you do have it equipped, right?), teaching him or her that spell forever! Now you can 
        return the favor and let loose a few missiles of your own... Once you've stolen that 
        Atomic Scissors, of course. 
        
        Speaking of stealing things, keep a special eye out for the Prowler enemies... These 
        annoying little punks like to hide in the back row, steal the most expensive item you own, 
        and then disappear in a cloud of gas. Do whatever it takes to kill them when they first 
        appear... If you wait until they've snagged something, it may be too late. 
        
        When you first arrive in Kalm, head to the inn to begin 
        Cloud's interactive flashback about Sephiroth, a man 
        you're going to be hearing quite a bit about. The results of 
        battles and such have no bearing on the rest of the game, 
        but there is one thing you can do in memory land that will 
        have consequences on the future. 
        
        When young Cloud arrives in Nibelheim, make sure you 
        go to visit Tifa's house, in the Southwest of town. Tifa's 
        room is on the second floor, 
        with the piano. The important 
        thing here is to sit down at the | 
        piano, and when Tifa asks if you actually played it, tell her that 
        you did, a little. Then remember the notes Cloud speaks aloud 
        as he played... You'll have to perform them five years later. Don't 
        worry about writing 'em down, I'll print them in the Nibelheim 
        section. Oh, and while you're here, you can risk Tifa's ire by | 
        going through her dresser, if you dare!

        There really isn't anything exciting to buy or do in Kalm, but there 
        is a lot of good stuff to steal. Once you've completed your official 
        business here (the only thing you have to do here, after the memo- 
        ry sequence, is talk to the miner in the bar), pillage the town for its 
        Guard Source, Megalixir, and two Ethers. You can even find one of 
        Vincent's weapons, long before you'll find Vincent himself. 
        
        
        
        
        It looks like you can make it 
        on foot, but the serpent 
        always catches up at the last 
        second. 
        
        
        
        
        Once you catch up with one, 
        ever so gently dispatch its 
        companions... 
        
        
        
        
        Or he'll run away after giving 
        everyone a good pecking. 
        
        
        
        Your next goal, clearly, is to cross the Mythril Mine 
        southeast of Kalm. Unfortunately, it's surrounded by a 
        swamp that seems to be the home of the dreaded 
        Midgarsorm, a very nasty creature that doesn't like visi- 
        tors (lust for the curious, the "Midgarsorm," is the leg- 
        endary giant serpent that circles the world of Midgar, 
        our world, in Norse mythology). 
        
        You can try killing it, but even if you do somehow 
        manage to survive long enough to get it down to 0 HP, its 
        post-death attack, (a learnable enemy skill that does 999 
        points of damage a piece) will probably take you down 
        with him. You can try outrunning him, but even though 
        you can get really, really close... You can't quite make it. 
        
        Your only chance is to run across on a zippy Chocobo, 
        and to do that, you'll need to purchase the Choco Lure 
        Materia from the proprietors of the Chocobo Ranch 
        (next page). Then run around on the Chocobo tracks 
        until one appears. Kill all the enemies (but don't hit the 
        Chocobo, this tends to upset them. Although, I do rec- 
        ommend you try it at least once. It's pretty cool to see a 
        Chocobo complete- 
        ly freak out) and 
        he's yours! You can 
        ignore what the 
        Chocobo ranchers 
        say about feeding 
        them "greens," the 
        Chocobos usually 
        don't care.

        Okay, it isn't exactly Chocobuckle, but that doesn't 
        make Flame Thrower not worth picking up. This spell 
        can seriously hurt enemies with a weakness to fire, 
        making it useful long after spells like Matra Magic 
        have become obsolete. Just don't let your guard 
        down when you're trying to learn it, or you could be 
        its first victim.

        Condor Fort is one of a number of completely optional areas in Final Fantasy 
        VII. Those who do choose to play will find it adds an interesting element of 
        variety to the game, and presents an opportunity to get a couple of modest 
        items in return. There are seven different battles at Condor Fort, each new 
        level of which is presented after a certain amount of time is elapsed. You must 
        do the battles in order, but if you miss any number of the first six (or even all 
        six of them), you can still fight in the deciding 7th battle, which is a major game 
        event. Those who are interested in conquering all six should check back often. 
        
        There are three ways to win at Condor Fort. One is simply to donate money 
        and let their commander do all the work. You win nothing for doing this, 
        except maybe the warm, squishy feeling that you've made a difference. 
        Another is to simply let the enemies invade and fight with their commander, in 
        a traditional FFVII battle. This is actually very easy, but it won't win you any- 
        thing either... Except in battle 7. 
        So the way to win is to fight the battle yourself, an 
        
        
        
        and give them their orders. The battle ends when the 
        enemy commander is killed, or when the fort is invaded. 
        If you do lose the battle when the fort is invaded, you 
        won't actually die, and Condor Fort will not fall... The only 
        penalty is that you will have to fight the battle again to 
        progress to the next one, and the prize you get won't be as

        While anyone with a lot of money should be able to beat just 
        about any Condor Fort battle, there are a few basic strategies 
        that will allow you to save a few of those hard-earned gil. 
        
        Know Your Troops! Attackers work best against Beasts, 
        Defenders are best against Barbarians, and Shooters are best 
        against Wyverns. Stoners and Catapults are a good buy, but 
        Workers and Repairers are pretty much a total waste. Why 
        waste time fooling around with little bombs? And there's not 
        much point in healing units that are going to become obsolete 
        by later waves of enemies anyway. 
        
        Know Your Terrain: The map was ingeniously designed, so the allows you to survey which ene- 
        higher you plan your defense, the mies are being sent after you, 
        less routes the enemies have to the and buy the troops best suited 
        base. If you put it up high, you'll to tabe them down - 
        only have to watch three paths, but you won't have much of a 
        margin of error if one gets through. Going lower gets you more 
        breathing room, but you'll have to defend four paths. 
        Whichever you choose, make good use of the natural corners in 
        setting up your traps. Stick catapults and stoners in areas 
        where their line of fire can't be avoided by enemies, and put 
        your guards as close to them as you can, so your foes will be 
        A perfect corner trap. By the pretty muc h dead by the time they even make it to your guards. 
        a™er°r; e wif h^T.os, ™* one exception is with Barbarians, who .ike to just stand 
        over half their health to the Tri there and shoot from a distance. Your troops have no AI, so 
        Stoners. you'll have to specifically order 
        
        them to attack the Barbarians. 
        Time is on Your Side: In the time before the battle begins, 
        only set up Catapults and Stoners and other stationary devices. 
        Begin the game, and watch for what the enemy sends... It does- 
        n't use all three types of units in the earlier battles, so why buy 
        Defenders if they're not going to use Barbarians? And since the 
        enemy usually sends its units in waves of the same type, watch 
        carefully which route they're going to take, and don't put out 
        
        your guard force (made of the type of unit they're strongest Barbarians can bjll cven 
        against, of course!) 'til you're sure they're not going to change Defenders with their ability to 
        course. It'll be a slaughter! shoot from afar, so mahe hilling 
        
        them priority one!

        leading us to Lower Junon's second 
        bonus game. If you're not in the mood 
        for figuring this one out, just hit O twice 
        without even 
        touching the

        dolphin will 
        take Cloud 
        exactly 
        where he | 
        needs to go.

        tricky, so

        I found the topography of Upper Junon to be complete- 
        ly baffling, a problem that I hope these maps (which 
        sort of work from right to left) won't only confound. 
        Upper Junon is just a city, there are no bosses or ran- 
        dom encounters, but there are a number of important 
        shops and items lying around, and if you miss them 
        the first time through, you won't get a second chance 
        until some time later. For that reason, be careful! If 
        you follow your party members onto the boat, you won't 
        be allowed to return! It's only the brief time between 
        the first and second mini games in which Cloud is free 
        to explore, so make the most of it. Once you begin the 
        review in front of Rufus and Heidekker, it'll already be 
        too late. 
        
        After you get Cloud in his soldier costume, 
        make sure you save the game at the save spot in 
        the first corridor. There are two mini- 
        games here, and the prizes you get are 
        based on how well you do at them... They're 
        it's unlikely you'll be getting the good stuff on your 
        
        
        
        
        The first mini-game has you rushing into formation at a 
        parade, and then trying to bob your gun or do whatev- 
        er it is they're doing (with the O button) in time with 
        the rest of the marchers. This might take some prac- 
        tice. When you get the signal from your captain, run 
        out and loop around the marchers, taking the lower - 
        most space in the 
        back line. Then 
        start pumping that 
        gun, or whatever.

        It's difficult to do very well on the military review 
        mini game, but luckily, you don't really have to. 
        I'll take the HP Plus Materia over the Force 
        Stealer anyday (it's a good sword for Cloud, but 
        you can just buy one in North Corel, two towns 
        away... You won't be able to get another HP Plus 
        until you get to Cosmo

        Everything looks calm now, but when 
        Sephiroth finds his way on board, that's 
        going to change real fast... So your first 
        priority is to gather together your com- 
        panions, finding and talking to each of 
        them. Barret seems strangely absent, so 
        go talk to Aerith again, and when you 
        return to the ship's deck you'll find the 
        
        soldier who had been blocking the way This guy disappears after 
        to the front of the ship has now disap- you talfe to Aerith the sec- 
        peared, freeing the way to Barret. 
        
        After a brief event, it will become 
        clear that something's happening in the 
        Engine Room, and you'll have to pick 
        two members from your reunited party 
        to investigate. Make sure you save the 
        game first!

        is your best offense against 
        bosses like Jenova with no 
        weaknesses. 
        
        
        
        
        Once your party is formed, head on down and get ready for battle. Don't forget to pick up 
        the Enemy-All in the main cargo room, now that Yuffie's done puking on it. Oh, and speak- 
        ing of Yuffie, if she's in your party you should open the chest in the metallic catwalk in the 
        engine room before you fight the boss... It contains a new weapon that'll come in handy. 
        
        
        
        This is the first of a handful of fights with lenova, Sephiroth' 
        decapitated mother. She looks tougher than she is, luckily, 
        and except for the tail laser that damages everybody, you 
        haven't got too much to worry about. Her stop spell can be 
        an annoyance, but lenova fights so sluggishly that the effect 
        won't lasts long enough to seriously corrupt your strategy- 
        lust make sure more than one characters has heal spells in 
        case one of your healers 
        
        
        
        get frozen, and keep the pM 
        HP up so you can survive 
        the Tail Laser blast. 
        
        Jenova doesn't have any 
        real weaknesses, so just Dr °P :

        Sephiroth, it seems, has passed 
        through the Corel mountains to the 
        West. You'll have to take this wind- 
        ing mountain path to get to the trail 
        head, and the route is fraught with 
        danger in the form of the Grangalan 
        enemies of the Corel Area. These 
        guys can generate up to two addi- 
        tional generations of Grangalans, making victory difficult. On 
        the up side, you earn extra XP and AP for each generation he 
        sires (killing him gets you a meager 88/10... Killing the whole 
        family gets you a considerable 363/36), and even the biggest 
        Grangalan family can be ended instantly with one or two bolts 
        aimed at grandpa (when he dies, they ALL die). 
        
        The Beach Plugs (which exist only near the shore line) have 
        a neat little enemy skill by the name of Big Guard, a potent 
        defensive magic that's a godsend for difficult bosses. 
        Unfortunately, there's no way they're going to intentionally cast it on YOU, so you'll have 
        to get it from them with the Manipulate Materia, a trick I'll talk more about a few pages 
        later. Don't forget to come back for this one!

        The Corel Mountains are relatively 
        straightforward... Although there 
        are a few paths in these maps that 
        seem to lead somewhere, like the 
        one leading from the center of the 
        Reactor to the mountain, and the 
        rocky ridge that heads towards the 
        Northeast in the bottom map, these 
        are complete dead ends. Just zip 
        through these areas as quickly as 
        you can... The enemies can be tough. 
        
        The Bagnadronas have a powerful 
        weapon for Red-XIII, if you can suc- 
        cessfully steal it, which is very diffi- 
        cult. But watch out for the Swell 
        Floats that usually accompany 
        them! Though not much trouble 
        alive, these weaklings hit the party 
        member who killed them for 1/3 of 
        their targets current health when 
        they die... If you're going to have 
        one character kill all three with a 
        single spell, you better make sure he 
        or she can stand to eat that much 
        damage afterwards! Ouch! Best to 
        spread it around, if possible.

        When the floor seems about 
        ready to fall in and you're 
        given the option to jump... 
        Don't! Instead hammer the 
        button and push the D pad 
        either left or right as you 
        fall... You'll land in just the 
        right place to pick up two 
        nice freebies... A Star 
        Pendant and Aerith's Wizard 
        Staff. You only get three 
        chances, so make sure to 
        save first! 
        
        
        
        To get across the bridge on 
        the bottom, you'll need to 
        open it up from the shed on 
        the upper right side. If you 
        visit your friends on the bot- 
        tom first, they'll give you an 
        opportunity to change your 
        party (if you say no, they 
        won't offer again). Leave 
        Aerith and Ufa behind, and 
        they'll jump around and root 
        for you when you're above.

        chickies! You can take their 
        treasure, which means you'll 
        have to slaughter their folks 
        (the treasure is 10 Phoenix 
        Downs), or you can leave 
        them be and show the ladies 
        how you're just Mr. Sensitive.

        f^My^PS i ust a Programming jobe. there are few secrets in FFV1I 
        that are more lucrative than the rare Test 0 enemies. 
        These blacb dogs exist only in the well beneath Corel 
        Prison, and your only chance to fight them is now... You'll 
        never be able to return to Corel Prison. 
        
        The combined HP total of these four dogs is 25 times 
        that of the hardest boss you've faced so far, but you do 
        have a chance... These dogs, luchily. don't fight bach. All 
        they do as you beat on them, hour after hour, is beg for 
        you to stop. 
        
        I don't like torturing friendly little animals any more 
        than the next guy. but the combined total of 4000 XP. 400 
        ' AP. and 40.000 gil (!!!) these guys hold made me swallow 
        my moral qualms real fast... After one bout with these 
        guys, you may end up never having to worry about money again! 
        
        Interested? lust wander around in the bottom of the well located in 
        the Northern half of Corel Prison until they appear, and then get ready 
        for a long fight. Your best bet is to just cast Poison on all four of them, 
        then go do something else for a while... Say. head down to your local 
        boob store and purchase the current line-up of fine Versus Boobs 
        products! By the time you're back, they'll be dead. Probably. Other 
        than that, you can rubber-band the O button on your controller down 
        (since the Test 0's are good at dodging, this will take an even 
        longer time), or if you've had a chance to fight enemies in the 
        Gold Saucer area, you can use the Gravity bombs dropped by ^iS^B 
        the Flap Beat enemies to hit any one Test 0 for 9999 points, 
        basically cutting your battle time in half.

        Dyne is here, just to the 
        North of Corel Prison 
        and then due East, 
        around the trashed cars, 
        and to the North. If you 
        deviate from this path, 
        you'll find yourself in the 
        barren desert (to the 
        right). The route to Dyne 
        is short, but you should 
        definitely stick around 
        long enough to pick up 
        the Laser skill from the 
        Death Claw enemies... 
        Now that you have the 
        Manipulate materia that 
        came with Cait Sith, you 
        can simply take control 
        of your enemy, and make 
        them cast the spell on 
        whoever has the Enemy 
        Skills Materia equipped! 
        You can also get Matra 
        magic here, if you 
        missed it earlier.

        If you go in any direction 
        other than the one that 
        leads to Dyne, you'll find 
        yourself lost in the end- 
        less, landmark-free 
        desert. After crossing 10 
        screens, a Chocobo 
        Carriage will offer to 
        take you back to town. 
        
        The only thing of note 
        in the Desert is the rare 
        Cactaur enemies, our 
        visiting friends from 
        previous FF games. 
        These tough little 
        enemies can 
        dodge pretty 
        much any normal attack, 
        are immune to most 
        types of magic (but 
        Choco/Mog works pretty 
        well), and run away after 
        only a turn or two. The 
        odds of meeting one are 
        a low l-in-8. So what's 
        the point? Well, each 
        one you kill will earn you 
        10,000 gil! Just like the 
        Test 0's. But beware of 
        the 7-in-8 odds Land 
        Worms. They can wear 
        you down quickly. 
        
        
        
        
        Boss Strategies 
        
        Barret has to fight this one alone, so give him Poison Materia 
        (essential when you're fighting defensively!) and Restore 
        Materia. Fight conservatively... Dyne can attack up to three times 
        in a row, so if your HP gets even halfway down, you're putting 
        yourself in serious jeopardy.

        Once Dyne's dead, Barret has no 
        problem persuading the Corel 
        Prison boss to send Cloud up to 
        the Chocobo races, a small for- 
        mality you'll have to succeed at 
        to win freedom for your party. 
        
        Don't forget to pick up the 
        Ramu materia that someone has 
        left lying around in the jockies' room, because once you 
        win your race, you won't get an opportunity to come back. 
        
        Winning the first time is diffi- 
        cult, but each time you lose your I 
        manager gets you better and [ 
        better Chocobos until you can 
        win easily. Whether you win on I 
        your 1st try or 5th, the reward is 
        always the same, so don't worry | 
        about this mini game too much.

        When you arrive in Gongaga,

        Turks are waiting. Once 
        they're gone, head East, mak- 
        ing sure you pick up the 
        Deathblow Materia, and then 
        North to Gongaga town. 
        
        There's not too much hap- 
        pening here, but one impor- 
        tant event unfolds here, if you have either Tifa or Aerith 
        (or both) in your party. Talk to the folks in the Southeast 
        home, and they'll tell of their Soldier son, Zacks. If Aerith 
        or Tifa are in your party, they'll react as if he were a for- 
        mer lover, and you'll have to go talk to them each indi- 
        vidually afterwards or risk losing love points. If neither 
        of them are in your party, by the way, Cloud's reaction 
        will change, and he'll suddenly remember that that name 
        does sound familiar. 
        
        After that, head back to the

        Turks, and then North to see

        They don't want you to 
        get ahead of things here, 
        so if you try to drive 
        past Cosmo Canyon, 
        your buggy will break down. No need 
        to worry... It'll eventually fix itself. 
        
        Make sure you're in good shape 
        before you begin the trip, as the lit- 
        tle maze of cliffs leading to Cosmo 
        Canyon is full of annoying enemies, 
        from hard-to-hit Sahagins to MP- 
        stealing Griffins. Unfortunately, 
        none of the enemies here have any- 
        thing particularly interesting to 
        give to you. 
        
        Cosmo Canyon is Red-XIH's 
        hometown, where he's known as 
        "Nanaki." I bet you're wondering 
        what happens if you name him 
        Nanaki from the beginning... Well 
        I'll fill you in... Nothing! You just get 
        a bunch of weird conversation bub- 
        bles when you get to Cosmo 
        Canyon saying things like "What? 
        Nanaki's name is Nanaki?" 
        
        
        
        
        There's simply no way to get 
        to get to that room on the 
        left... yet. You'll have to come 
        back in disc 2.

        first one is from within 
        the cave leading to the 
        lower left corner of the map, and just off to the right. 
        The path leading to the chest in the upper left is right 
        behind the large rock just to the right of it.

        bered it, except for the part 
        about it not having burnt down, 
        and you having ever lived 
        there. Well, there's no point 
        looking for answers here, 
        because there aren't any. AH 
        you'll find are cloaked, tattooed 
        weirdos babbling about a 
        reunion. But that doesn't mean 
        you shouldn't talk to them all, 
        'cause many of them are hold- 
        ing really good items that 
        they're too clueless to miss. 
        From here, the next required stop is Rocket Town, and you'll have 
        to cut through the equally memory-laden Nibel mountains to get 
        there. But first, let's pay a little visit to the Shinra mansion... 
        
        Oh, and let's not forget Tifa's piano! If you 
        remembered the tune you played back in 
        the Kalm memory sequence, play it now, 
        
        
        
        three times in a row. If you do it correctly, you get... a buck! Yeah! Don't spend it all in one 
        place, ya hear? Ha ha! Sucker! 
        
        Seriously though, this isn't what I was talking about when I told you you'd get something 
        good here. The real items, Tifa's level 4 limit break and an Elemental Materia, can only be got- 
        ten in discs 2 and 3. 
        
        
        
        
        
        Shinra mansion is host to the most bizarre, annoying, and difficult ene- 
        mies you've faced so far... You may end up spending quite a bit of time 
        in here, so make sure you exit to save and heal often, and never let 
        your guard down! 
        
        Among the most dangerous are the dreaded, um, "Funny Faces." You 
        can wipe them out with one mass-kill magic spell, but they usually get 
        to go first, giving them a chance to confuse the caster and make him 
        cast it on his own comrades! Because of this, I heartily recommend 
        you give every character at least one summon spell- since summon 
        spells cannot be turned against your P 
        own party, a creature summoned by a t , 
        confused character will still wipe out , 
        the Funny Faces (the spell will still be 
        nullified by Silence, though, so assign | 
        more than one character to cast sum- 
        mon spells, just in case).

        A puzzle! The fourth part of I 
        the combination is easy 
        (just select the unlisted 4th 
        command on the screen | 
        where it asks you for j 
        
        hints) You can find Answer 1 is right here behind 
        the others with a the P iano - 
        bit of legwork, 
        or just cheat I 
        and get the 
        combination 
        from me (Bight | 
        36, Left 10, Right 59, 
        97). Enter it quick- 
        ly, and make sure you never hi HEIr%\ 
        overshoot any number! Answer 2 is over here... Not in 
        And don't even think of , 
        doing this unless your party 
        is in top physical shape... a |

        iAs you go about your business in Shinra 
        mansion, you'll constantly be pestered by 
        Judge enemies, and their annoying ability 
        to dodge most physical attacks. But you 
        t definitely want to pick a fight with these | 
        \ guys, because they possess what is pos- 
        j sibly the most useful enemy skill in the | 
        i game... A little spell called "????" This technique follows the proud 
        Chocobuckle tradition of enemy skills whose damage can only be fig- 
        L ured out by a mathematical formula... This one subtracts your current 
        L HP from your HP max and does exactly that amount of damage to a sin- 
        ^ gle target. It never misses, and having no magical "type" it can be used 
        [ against enemies that are immune to other types of magic. Best of all, 
        I it's just 3 MP! 
        
        Of course, you'd expect to go through quite a hassle to get yourself 
        I a nice spell like this, and the Judges are I 
        I happy to oblige you in that regard. They I 
        I rarely cast the spell, and since they can't be I 
        effected by Manipulate Materia, you've just I 
        [ got to wait and hope that they cast it on whoever I 
        , has Enemy Skills materia equipped. It takes a lot | 
        of patience, but if any skill's worth it, it's this one. 
        Equally annoying but far less rewarding are Ying & Yang. Ah, how much fun the developers | 
        must have had designing the movement for these two epileptic freaks. They're fun, sure, but j 
        ■ since a Ying & Yang battle tends to be incredibly time-consuming, you | 
        | might want to call in your new friend Odin to cut through their the- 
        atrics.

        Anyway, let's get back to business... If you've opened the safe and 
        gotten the key, open the door to Vincent's, um, bedroom. Talk to him 
        until he has nothing more to say, then let him sleep while you go to 
        visit Sephiroth, who's waiting in the library with a few cryptic 
        clues and a lovely present for Cloud. Make sure you 
        search through all of the research notes and samples for 
        some more baffling hints. 
        
        Vincent will ask you to leave 
        him alone if you wake him 
        again, but he will emerge and 
        try to join you if you try to 
        leave the underground area. If 
        he doesn't, then you didn't talk 
        to him enough!

        Your only real goal here is to get through to Rocket Town, a 
        simple route that requires only that you kill the Materia 
        Keeper in the lower right-hand corner of the 2nd map, and 
        walk on through (don't miss the Counter materia he leaves 
        behind!). But if you want to pick up the rest of the items on 
        the 2nd map and a few other items later on, or revisit the 
        Reactor where Cloud first confronted Sephiroth, you have a 
        much longer journey ahead of you. We'll explore that area 
        on the next page. 
        
        To get an item here, you'll have to either 
        go down pipe #4 for the bag with a 
        Enemy-All Materia in it, or pipe #2 lor 
        Tifa's Powersoul weapon.

        even worth doing. But I 
        hope, nay, I expect that all 
        true FF fans will challenge 
        the phalanx of enemies that 
        await on this long and 
        winding road, and endure 
        their relentless onslaught 
        in the pursuit of the few 
        meager items (nothing of 
        worth other than a new 
        Vincent weapon, really), 
        that remain to be acquired 
        in the deepest recesses of 
        the Nibel mountains. Make

        to enter this cave, turn left

        I As you can see, this route ultimately 
        leads back to the Reactor where Cloud 
        faced Sephiroth in the Kalm memory 
        sequence, but the door to Jenova's room 
        is now locked, and there's not a single 
        clue to suggest what might have hap- 
        pened here, so many years ago... 
        
        
        
        Door #10 
        leads right bacfe to where you started. 
        Except now you can collapse the ladder 
        down to the south of it, giving you a way 
        to get bacfe up to the mouths of the pipes. 
        So you can now get whichever item it was 
        you missed the first time. After that, it's 
        off to Rocbet Town.

        Head over to Cid's house (the 
        Northernmost one) and take a 
        look at the Tiny Bronco in his 
        yard. Shera will appear and ask 
        you to go find Cid, up at the 
        rocket. He won't come back 
        with you, but head back to 
        Shera's anyway. She's having an 
        interesting guest over... Good 
        'ol Palmer! Cid will appear 
        himself, and offer you his, uh, 
        "hospitality." 
        When Rufus arrives, peak at the 
        goings-on outside and then let 
        Shera escort you to the Tiny 
        Bronco... It's yours, as long as you 
        can get it away from Palmer(which 
        won't be hard). 
        
        
        
        
        
        It's small, but the man in the picture on 
        the wail of the item shop is none other 
        than Final Fantasy series producer 
        Hironobu Sakaguchi! Make sure you 
        stop by and pay your respects. 
        
        
        
        Oooh... Are you prepared to feel the lukewarm rage of a dangerously obese Shinra 
        executive? Yep, you can probably handle this one on your own. But what the hell, I've 
        got space to fill, so I'll fill you in on the pointless details. Palmer has some sort of 
        crazy Shinra gun that's able to do all sorts of different types of damage, but all of them 
        in pretty small amounts. He's weak on defense and he's not immune to any type of 
        magic, so you can really just work him with anything. Have fun!

        So, where to now? The 
        Temple of the Ancients isn't 
        far away, but as the black- 
        smith in Gongaga area will 
        tell you, you'll need to get 
        the hey from Dio at Gold 
        Saucer first. You can go do 
        that right now (full details on 
        page 5 1 ) But before you head 
        there, why not sail due west 
        for the Utai area? It's an 
        optional quest that I'm sure 
        you'll find entertaining, and 
        the rewards are quite 
        impressive.

        pen, although you can still go 
        to Utai and shop and stuff, 
        (as long as you're still on 
        disc 1, you can always go get 
        Yuffie and then come back),

        From the landing 
        spot pictured here, 
        head North over the 
        bridges, then south 
        and around the cliff 
        to get to the second 
        bridge. But you won't 
        get more than a few 
        steps into your quest 
        when Yuffie sicks two 
        Shinra soldiers on you, 
        then takes your Materia and 
        splits. 
        
        It's hard to believe, but 
        there are limits even to 
        Yuffie's greed (or at least 
        limits to how much she can 
        get away with), as she 
        "only" takes 48 of your 
        Materia. If you have more 
        than that, she'll leave the 
        ones that come first in the 
        Materia screen's ordering 
        system, leaving me with 
        three fire Materia and absolutely nothing else. 
        
        The two guards are the least of your problems... The 
        enemies in Utai area are difficult, and the route to 
        town is anything but clear. And, of course, you have 
        virtually no materia! I hope you've been stockpiling 
        healing items... You're gonna need them! Now would 
        also be a good time to use up the ton of magic spell- 
        casting items you no doubt have lying around. 
        
        You might also want to pick a party with powerful 
        weapons and lots of physical constitution, and set 
        their limit breaks to low levels so they can use them 
        more often. It's as close as you're going to get to 
        magic for some time now... 
        
        
        
        
        And it's too bad you've already lost all that materia, 'cause there are two enemy skills 
        you'll want to pick up here in the Utai area. When you have your materia back (I'll 
        remind you) you'll need to come back and pick fights with both the Adamantaimai and 
        the Razor Weeds. Neither will voluntarily cast their spells (ever!) so you'll need to get 
        it out of them by controlling them with the Manipulate materia and then making them 
        cast it on you. The two spells are Magic Hammer, which, steals 100 MP from its target, 
        and Death Force, which attempts to cast two different death spells on all targets. These 
        are the only enemies in the game who are capable of c asting these spells, so don't miss 
        
        I this opportunity! 
        
        The armor the 
        Adamantaimai holds 
        is excellent as well... 
        So grab it as soon as 
        you get Materia back!

        2. Find Yuffie's 4 hiding places (in order).

        her and reclaim 
        your Materia, 
        you'll need to 
        pursue her in 
        the following 
        order:

        Open the chest in the

        Talfe to Godo. Continue talk- 
        ing to him until Yuffie 
        appears. 
        
        
        
        Yuffie's next hiding place is 
        behind the screen in Utai's 
        Southeastern-most house. 
        
        
        
        
        
        You'll get the MP Absorb you found 
        in the Materia shop chest when 
        Yuffie rejoins you. After that, you 
        can also go to the building with all 
        the cats, and collect HP Absorb as 
        well (they won't move out of the 
        way unless Yuffie's rejoined you... I 
        guess Yuffie got to them too). 
        
        Unfortunately, the MP/HP rebate 
        you get when you use these is 
        pathetically low... 1/10 of the dam- 
        age you dealt when using HP 
        Absorb, and only 1/100 when using 
        MP Absorb! 
        
        In addition to those, don't miss 
        the two secret weapons in Godo's 
        house's hidden passages.

        lyv 4 limit break) is at state

        hours later when all of your characters are far more pow-

        lenge. Besides, the sooner you get Leviathan the better, 
        right? 
        
        It's gonna take a good deal of strategy to get someone 
        like Yuffie, who's not much of a heavy hitter, through all 
        five floors. They hey is in the Materia: Make sure you give 
        Yuffie the standard compliment of anti-boss spells! That 
        means Poison, Barrier (a defensive must), Time magic (for 
        Haste), your highest level 
        Restore Materia, a couple of 
        powerful attach magics (if 
        l'' ^ Yuffie has a high HP max, the 
        
        , M *t»v enemy skill ???? could be use- 
        
        ' i n iiiii n ni it" fuI)l and 3,1 the HP and MP 
        Poison: The gift that beeps on Plusses you have. Gravity is a 
        giving! great choice too, lopping off 
        
        half your opponent's HP! 
        Remember, you can leave the tower, heal, and change 
        your equipment after every battle. So you might want to 
        pop on an anti-paralysis accessory for your fight against 
        Chehhov, for example. It's sort of cheating, but who cares? 
        
        After that, your strategy should be clear... Hit them with 
        poison early, cast Barrier and Haste on yourself, and then 
        . f'Sht conservatively, healing 
        
        ^^^^^^I^^^N^^ yourself even if you're not too

        still tafee poison damage, and 
        You can double your lifespan any att acfes they do will just 
        with Barrier magic bm , d your , imk breafe met£r 
        
        The exception here is Godo, who can heal himself, so you'll 
        want to hill him as quickly as possible. (Or, if you have 
        Reflect magic, cast that on him so his heal spells will hit 
        you instead!) 
        
        Speaking of limit breaks, if you have Yuffie's second 
        level 2 limit break, this should be a snap... That combo can 
        do nearly 3000 points of damage in a single attack! If you 
        
        don't, stick with her 
        level 1 limit breaks, as 
        
        
        
        level 1 limit breaks, as 
        the hit-every-enemy 1st 
        level 2 limit break isn't 
        very powerful, and it's 
        always good to have the 
        option to use her level 1 
        healing limit break, too.

        The blacksmith in 
        Gongaga area is no longer 
        in posession of the 
        Keystone... it's Dio's now. 
        Yeah, that Dio. Icfe. So 
        next stop, Gold Saucer! 
        
        
        
        
        ' Gee, for some reason it feels like I just did a 
        
        major duel... Well, worry not, 'cause this one's 
        substantially different. The eight enemies 
        you're going to face here are random, and you 
        can get the Keystone even if you wash out of the 
        very first round. But those who make it to round 5 or later (and then quit) get a Protect Vest as a 
        prize, and those who clear all eight on the first try (that's us) get a Choco Feather on top of that. 
        
        The enemies here aren't so strong, but Cloud gets slapped with a new handicap every round. 
        The key is to match your strategy for winning with getting the right handicaps. I loaded Cloud up 
        with HP Plus Materia, heal spells, and the Enemy Skills materia. Spells like Haste, Kegen, and 
        Barrier are incredibly effective here because their effects carry on to the next round. Then, I 
        intentionally took the "weapon breaks" handicap every time I could. Although the effects are 
        cumulative, I didn't plan on ever using my weapon anyway. (For obvi- 
        ous reason, try to avoid "armor breaks" like the plague) Once again, 
        the enemy skill "????" spell proved to be the most efficient damage- 
        dealer in the game... No enemy can block, reflect, or absorb its dam- -^ff^tijt^ 
        age, and it only costs 3 mp, so even if you take two or three "MP 
        halved" handicaps in a row, you can use it as much as you need to. >„ 
        
        With lots of HP Plusses, Cloud's HP max was nice and high, and by 
        
        waiting 'til the last opportunity to heal myself, ???? dished out the seri- miimib in » «iZl """ 1

        j After the duel, 
        I which begins as 
        I soon as you 
        check out the 
        Keystone in 
        Dio's museum, 
        at the Battle 
        I Square, you'll 
        find that the tram out of Gold Saucer has 
        broken down. Pretty suspicious timing... 
        
        So Cloud and the gang head down to the 
        Ghost Inn 
        where it's time 
        to fill the new- 
        bies in on the 
        game's plot. 
        After that, 
        Cloud returns 
        to his room 
        (don't forget v to grab the elixir in the cabi- 
        net afterwards), where the character with 
        whom he has the highest number of "love 
        
        points" visits 
        
        him to begin the 
        date sequence. 
        After the date, 
        head southeast 
        to the temple in 
        Woodland area. 
        
        
        
        
        
        There are four char- 
        acters you can date: 
        Aerith, Tifa, Yuffie, 
        and, uh... Barett. 
        99.9% of all gamers 
        will get either Tifa or 
        Aerith (which one 
        depends on how well 
        you treated them, and 
        how often you used 
        them). To get Barett 
        or Yuffie, you'd have 
        to go way out of your 
        way to be as cruel as 
        humanly possible, 
        and never use them in 
        battle (if you rack up a single love point with 
        Tifa or Aerith, that person would be your date). 
        
        Anyway, this date ends with a high-speed 
        chase where you'H have to follow Cait Sith 
        through four or five different Gold Saucer loca- 
        tions, before he ends up outside of Chocobo 
        - Square. 
        
        By the way. the only way to 
        get the happy ending in the 
        play is to make the follow- 
        ing choices: 
        
        1. Become a magic user. 
        
        2. Ask about the demon's 
        weak point. 
        
        3. Talk to the princess. 
        
        
        
        
        Evidently one Evangelion fan 
        at Square managed to sneak a 
        hidden reference to his 
        favorite anime into FFVII... 
        Search the robot suit in the 
        background here... Look 
        familiar? It was from the 
        Magma Diver episode of the 
        Evangelion TV anime. And 
        just to make sure no one 
        thinks it's a coincidence, the 
        programmers gave it the 
        same model type (if you 
        search it) as the actual 
        Magma Diver in the anime.

        The temple is in the little island

        temple is visible from the

        tahe it from Tseng. 
        
        The first part of the temple is 
        a fairly straightforward maze.

        marked #1. #2 and the chest 
        near it are not accessible at this

        Bone Village/Zango Valle 
        
        
        
        1 . Excavate the Lunar Harp. 
        
        2. Cross the Sleeping Forest and Zango 
        Valley to get to the Forgotten Gity. 
        
        
        
        
        Enemies Appearing in 
        Zango Valley 
        
        
        
        
        On the Southern coast of the 
        Northern continent lies Bone 
        Village, a city devoted to 
        archaeology. You've got to wonder how much 
        longer they can continue to excavate the same 
        twenty or thirty square feet, but you might as 
        well enjoy it while it lasts, and have them dig up 
        a few things for you. All you do is hire members 
        of the team (at 100 gil a pop) to stand where you 
        tell them, and detonate a small explosive. They 
        "track the sonic waves," or some such nonsense, 
        and point in the direction of the item, which you 
        can have them dig up overnight. 
        
        What they dig up changes a few times during 
        the game, and Bone Village is where you can get 
        the bey to return to Midgar (late in disc 2) and a 
        number of major items in disc 3 if you missed them earlier. 
        
        For now, the pickings are slim-- barely enough to make 
        j it worth playing the tedious Bone Village excavation mini- 
        game even a few times. Of course, you'll need to get the 
        Lunar Harp, a key item whose position never changes. 
        Ask them to excavate this specifically, I've circled it on the 
        left. 
        
        After that, there are one or two "good" treasures, such 
        as a Megalixir and new weapons for Cid (his Materia slot- 
        free Mop) and Vincent (the "Shortbarrel," a pretty good 
        gun that gives you double AP). There are no good "nor- 
        mal" treasures at this time. 
        Once you have the harp, you can cross the forest. But 
        j don't miss Kujata in your haste! This novel summon spell 
        blinks in and out of the forest, so just look for a fleeting 
        red spot, then go to where you saw it last and wait for it 
        to reappear. Also, don't forget to do a bit of shopping 
        while in Bone Village! They may not have any proper 
        shops, but the guy waiting by the door sells the usual 
        assortment of items, as well as Diamond and Rune arm- 
        lets. The Rune armlet has four double-AP Materia slots, which in the long run will make 
        it more than worth its lack of defensive value, especially _ 
        if you're trying to get the master materia later on. 
        
        One other note about the area.- Watch out for the ' 
        incredibly tough Brachioladus enemies. They're not 
        worth fighting now, but take note of their existence. 
        They're the only source of Carob Nuts in the game, an I 
        item that will be come important when (and if) you start | 
        raising your own Chocobos.

        Icicle Lodge is the last 
        outpost of civilization 
        for quite a few game 
        hours, so enjoy it while 
        you can! Heal up, buy 
        new weapons for every- 
        one, and make sure you 
        save your game before 
        you enter, because the 
        Turks are in hot pur- 
        suit... And when they 
        catch up with you 
        (which happens as soon 
        as you try to leave to the 
        north) they're not going 
        to let you leave again. 
        
        The quest will continue as soon as you 
        acquire the snowboard and head on down There's a 
        the Northern slope that's the only

        remaining exit. But 
        there's plenty to do 
        first. For example, 
        check out the house in 
        the upper left. It does- 
        n't look like much, but 
        this is where Dr. Gust 
        and Ifalna hid from 
        Shinra and gave birth 
        to their baby daugh- 
        ter... It's a tale that's been captured by the various video 
        clips you can access via the computer on the ground 
        floor. 
        
        Ice Gate, the giant glacial dungeon that's just ahead, is 
        by far the largest area 
        
        
        
        I the game. You can pick 
        up a hand-drawn map 
        from the explorer on 
        the right side of town. 
        _| It's hanging right there 
        on the wall, and you can ask the man outside for per- 
        mission to take it (or you can just steal it). 
        Unfortunately, the overly simplistic map you'll receive 
        is next to useless. 
        Finally, you'll need the snowboard, the child in the 
        | center house has it, 
        and will give it to you 
        for free, but not until 
        the event happens with 
        the Shinra guards, 
        once she does, head 
        out the northern exit 
        and prepare for a great 
        mini game!

        Don't take the snowboarding ^ 
        game too seriously... It's all 
        just for fun. Watching your 
        time and getting balloons 
        won't make any difference in 
        where you land, and there 
        are no prizes you can win. 
        Once you've cleared this 
        game, you can 
        play it again by 
        returning to 
        town and going 
        down the same 
        slope, or you 
        can play a modi- 
        fied version in 
        Gold Saucer. 
        
        
        
        
        The course splits twice, 
        and which route you take 
        determines where your char- 
        acters will land to begin the 
        giant Ice Gate Glacier maze. 
        I've marked each starting 
        point both here and on the 
        map that you'll find on pages 
        60 and 61. If you 
        want to save 
        your game after 
        the snowboard 
        game, aim for 
        point LR, it's 
        closest to the 
        exit. 
        
        
        
        
        The Ice Gate Glacier is a massive dungeon, featuring 
        about sixty different areas. Since six of the linking paths 
        repeat a number of times each, it's very easy to get con- 
        fused. I've mapped out the entire dungeon on pages 60 
        to 61... As you can see, it's quite massive, but features sur- 
        prisingly few locations of interest. There are really only 
        two items worth the trouble of getting in the entire dun- 
        geon: the very cool Added Cut materia, and the call spell 
        Alexander, a giant robot castle thingy that pummels his 
        ^^^^^^^ foes with incredibly 
        
        |Bandersnatch 
        
        
        
        
        
        heavy Holy-type dam- 
        age (this is one of only two Holy-typed spells in the 
        game). Yep, he's even stronger than Bahamut! 
        
        To get both, try to land at RL or RR, where you'll be 
        fairly close to the hot springs. Dip your hands in it, then 
        either wait for your party to expire, or head north and 
        then west to get to the central map. From there you can 
        head east to touch the witch, destroy her, and get 
        Alexander. While you're in the neighborhood, you can 
        grab Added Cut as well. 
        
        Once that's accom- IBS 
        plished, you're pretty ' 9g 
        much done here. But t» 
        don't get too excited, \ - 
        
        Ice Gate is just the IBk <iy 
        first of three consecu- MtT

        As Ice Gate explorers will soon discover, you can't wander for long before Cloud and 
        company pass out from exposure. This occurs after a certain amount of distance trav- 
        
        
        
        
        
        Erf* elled, and can not be prevented (note that this has no connection to the amount of time 
        | elapsed, so if you're thinking of taking a shortcut to get back to the central map by leav- 
        \ ing your party to freeze for a while, it's not going to work). 
        
        When you expire, you'll find yourself in a cabin the 
        j foothills of the menacing Gaea's Cliff, your next challenge. 
        If you're ready to move on, fine. Talk to the man who 
        saved you to heal yourself, then save at the save spot and 
        I pick your party. 
        
        If you want to return to various Ice Gate locations you 
        missed, you're going to have to deal with the central map. This area seems like the game's 
        overhead map, but is not directly connected to it. Every screen of it looks the same, and 
        it's basically just a giant square. If you make it to the top of the square, you'll be back at 
        the foothills. If you go South, West, or East, you'll find yourself at the various Ice Gate 
        locations depicted on the map on the next page. So all you do to get where you want to | 
        go is pick a direction and walk that way for a couple of screens. Sounds easy, doesn't it? [ 
        
        Well, unfortunately the central map is constantly being swept by blizzards that rotate 
        the screen around and destroy your sense of direction. Since there are absolutely no nat- 
        ural landmarks, you'll have to make your own with the stakes you can set with the O but- 
        ton. These are easy to use... As you walk, simply press the O button every few steps so I 
        that there are always at least two or three stakes visible on screen (three is the max you 
        can have before the old ones disappear). When the blizzard strikes, just stop in your | 
        tracks and wait it out. When it's over, you can figure out which direction you were walk- 
        ing in by simply drawing a line between Cloud's current position and the stakes that are | 
        behind him. It's tricky to get going in the exact same direction, but since you can enter your target location by hitting any 
        part of that side of the square, this should be sufficient to insure you get where you want to be. 
        Actually, there is one other location within the central map. Smack dab in the middle of it is a small cave that contains... 
        
        (gasp!) another Enemy- 
        All Materia! Yes, you 
        should have like twelve 
        of them by now, but if 
        you still feel you could 
        use another, here's your 
        opportunity. Since the 
        cave is in the dead cen- 
        ter of the map, you'll 
        have to walk straight in 
        the opposite direction 
        (for example, if you 
        leave from Gaea's Cliff, 
        head due South). You 
        don't have much of a 
        margin for error, so 
        make sure you use your 
        stakes! And memorize 
        which direction you 
        came from in relation to 
        the cave's entrance... 
        When you leave, it won't 
        be facing the same way 
        and your stakes will 
        have disappeared.

        worth a salt here in Ice Gate. 
        One is Alexander, a call spell 
        posessed by the which in Ice 
        Gate's North Eastern cave. 
        The witch hates hot springs, 
        so if you talk to her after dip- 
        ping your hand in the nearby 
        hot springs, she'll attack you 
        (she's just a Snow enemy, not 
        a boss). Remember, due to 
        that crazy one-way road, 
        you'll have to exit to the bliz- 
        zard-striken map in the mid- 
        dle of Ice Gate and then go 
        East to get to her.

        To be able to head north 
        from here, you'll need to 
        get onto the frozen ice in 
        the like. There's only 
        one point in which you 
        can cross to it, and that's 
        right here, where the ice 
        is closest to the shore.

        Don't forget the old man's 
        advice... You'll end up right 
        back in the cabin in the 
        foothills if you let your 
        body temperature fall 
        below 26 (and when it gets 
        low, it falls fast!). Whenever you get to a ledge, ham- 
        mer on that square button... You can raise your tem- 
        perature up to 38 degrees, which is a much needed 
        precaution on some of the later cliffs, where climbs 
        frequently lead to dead ends... 
        
        To make things even worse, the cliff's external areas 
        are populated by one of the most annoying enemies in 
        the game. Molbors can turn your entire party into 
        confused, sleeping, silent, poisoned frogs in a single 
        blast. If you don't have any Ribbons or anything 
        equipped, your only realistic option will be to 
        escape... But even that won't always work, as the poi- 
        son could kill your party of frogs while they're sleep- 
        ing. So equip a precautionary accessory on at least 
        one party member! The only bright note is that you 
        can learn this spell yourself with the Enemy Skills 
        materia. 
        
        To beat the dungeon I 
        below, you'll have to get 
        to the second part of the 
        dungeon and push the 
        rock down to break the I 
        spikes (not pictured) that [

        here, on the

        There's a 
        Ribbon in 
        the chest, 
        definitely 
        one of the 
        best acces- 
        sories in the 
        game, and a 
        "must have"

        by Molbors.

        You'll have to cross the [ 
        frozen external area to 
        get to the room pictured 
        on the right. Only by 
        knocking down all four 
        of these icicles (easily 
        accomplished since they 
        don't fight back) can you 
        make the bridge to let [ 
        
        you progress (map version 2), and get the treasure 
        chest in the upper right hand corner. Ignore the 
        message that asks you if you want to jump down 
        after each icicle... If you jump early, you'll have to 
        climb all the way back up to get the chest on the left! 
        Just say "no" each time, get the chest, then leave the 
        room and return immediately. You'll be given the 
        option to jump again! 
        
        In addition to the 
        Molbor's Bad Breath 
        skill, you can get the 
        powerful but expensive 
        Magic Breath from this 
        enemy... He also knows 
        Trine, in case you didn't 
        learn that earlier.

        points of damage a piece, possibly even twice that, depending on the magic 
        power of the caster! But don't even think of using Kujata here... Make sure you 
        use Alexander early on, as opposed to saving him for the killing blow. For one 
        thing, the boss is much easier if you can kill one of his heads early on. But a bet- 
        ter reason is the fact that each head casts a final attack before it dies... A lightning 
        blast that can do up to 1500 points per character! If you mess up and kill them at the same time,

        Keep your tempera- 1

        white, radiant pool in the middle... It completely

        The Crater is a tiny area, with only two locations. Once 
        you climb down the hill and through the spires, you'll 
        enter the Whirlwind Maze, a brief area with a dramatic 
        conclusion that marks the end of this part of the quest. 
        
        Since the Crater is so short, you might want to run 
        around in it for a while so you're guaranteed a chance to 
        run into Gigas, one of the game's coolest-looking ene- 
        mies. You can also steal the mediocre Gigas armlet from 
        him... It actually increases your physical strength, but 
        won't raise your Materia.

        The gusts of wind 
        that you face three 
        times in this dungeon 
        aren't as difficult as 
        they look. You can 
        pretty much ignore 
        the big green gusts of 
        wind and bolts of 
        lightning... What con- 
        cerns you is the big layer of general wind that's 
        sweeping through the area. You may have to 
        wait five or ten seconds, but when it calms 
        down, it should give you plenty of time to make 
        it across. 
        
        Supposedly, the cloaked lizard Tonberi, one of 
        the bosses in the Gold Saucer duel is lurking 
        somewhere around here, but the odds of actual- 
        ly running into him are incredibly low... I tried 
        for hours and never actually did. If you do see him, 
        brace yourself for a tough fight. You can't run away, 
        and he can kill characters with a single touch. You 
        have a few turns 'til he gets over to your side, so 
        blast him with everything you have (Gravity is 
        especially effective) so you can snuff out his 15000 
        HP before he becomes a real threat. 
        
        In the scene pictured here, you can choose which 
        character to entrust the black materia with, Red- 
        XIII or Barret. It doesn't

        Well, this is an interesting twist... Cloud's 
        gone, the party's been scattered, and Tifa's 
        in the gas chamber. You play Barret dur- 
        ing this sequence of mostly uncontrollable events, joined by 
        Cait Sith and Yuffie, if she's in your party. Once the gas cham- 
        ber is sealed, you'll have to make a dash to the airport, where 
        you'll switch to control of Tifa. There will be a handful of enemy 
        fights on the way, so take a few minutes to rearrange your mate- 
        ria, or Barret, Yuffie and Cait Sith won't stand a chance. 
        
        As Tifa, you'll have to get the guard's 
        dropped key by making her struggle within 
        the chair. Once you have the key between 
        your legs, you'll need to have her grab it 
        with her teeth by pressing the buttons for 
        both legs and head at the same time, and 
        then the buttons for either arm and the 
        y head to have her unlock her 
        restraints. Shut off the gas source 
        (behind the chair and to the left), 
        then simply wait for Sapphire 
        Weapon to do the rest. 
        
        You can ignore the guards that 
        pursue Tifa, they'll never catch 
        her no matter how long you wait. 
        Scarlet will, however, and you can 
        best her in the ensuing slap fight 
        (not that you get anything for it) if 
        you're quick. The best strategy is 
        to hit the button the second she 
        raises her arm, you'll always get 
        that first slap in!

        Highwind is yours, and you're finally free to explore what is pretty much the entire over- 
        world map. After so many hours stuck in the icy north, you've probably been wondering 
        what's changed in the warmer southern areas. Quite a bit, actually. Most villagers say new 
        things, many shops have been restocked, the routes to a few important items have been 
        cleared, and a couple of new locations are now accessible. To advance the storyline, your 
        next stop is the town on the far southern island of Mideel, but why not first take the time 
        to see what's changed elsewhere on the map? This section covers just about every major 
        change that's taken place in the locations you've previously visited, and I'll try to update 
        you on every subsequent area change in the sections ahead. Since none of the things list- 
        ed here are crucial to the completion of the quest, impatient gamers should skip ahead. 
        
        Nibelheim 
        
        There's not a whole lot going 
        on in Nibelheim, but there are 
        two noteworthy things. One is 
        that good 'ol piano... If Tifa 
        plays it while she's the leader, 
        you'll get another Elemental 
        materia. Better than getting 
        another 1 gil, I suppose. 
        
        
        
        Although you've seen all of these enemies before, your lack of the Manipulate Materia (or your 
        low level of defense in the case of the Midgarsorm) probably prevented you from getting their 
        enemy skills. Since these are three very useful spells, they're well worth the trip back.

        Heh heh heh... Remember us? 
        Now that you're strong 
        enough to survive the 
        Midgarsorm's devastating final 
        attack, you can learn it and 
        gain one of the most powerful 
        mass kill enemy skills. The 
        'sorm is uncontrollable, but 
        he'll cast it if you kill him 
        when he's very low on health. 
        So hit him with weak attacks 
        until he gets angry and stands 
        straight up. Then finish him 
        with a couple of weak hits and 
        hope he casts it. 
        
        
        
        These harmless little critters 
        are located only in the shore- 
        line in the Corel Area. 
        Although they never cast it 
        themselves, they possess the 
        incredibly useful Big Guard, a 
        skill that casts Barrier, Magic 
        Barrier, and Haste on all three 
        of you! It's a bit steep at 56 
        mp, but the ability to cast all 
        three of those spells on every- 
        one at the same time (without 
        even wasting a Materia slot!) is 
        priceless. This is one of the 
        best enemy skills. 
        
        
        
        Once Zemzelett tormented 
        you, but now you can kill him 
        in one shot. Still, resist the 
        temptation long enough to 
        control him and get your 
        hands on White Wind, the first 
        of only two enemy skill heal 
        spells. This one heals the 
        whole gang for X amount of 
        HP, where X equals the cast- 
        er's current HP total. Not 
        quite as good as Cure3 + 
        Enemy-All, but it won't waste 
        two materia slots and it heals 
        most status conditions to 
        boot! 
        
        
        
        
        The second item of interest

        Many shops have been completely restocked, mostly with items that could previously be 
        found but not bought. Costa Del Sol's weapon "shop" is a notable exception, as it sells a num- 
        ber of exclusive 8 Materia Slot weapons.

        Junon 
        
        
        
        
        It's a weapon shopper's paradise in Junon, where the two old arms shops have updated their stock, and former accessory and 
        materia shops are selling 'em too! There are a total of five weapons dealers in Junon, and you can buy all sorts of crazy things 
        here. Their stocb includes the series of powerful, unconventional weapons with no materia slots, the series of powerful weapons 
        with 8 non-connected materia slots, the very useful series of double AP weapons (at the shop pictured on the left), and a bunch 
        of other miscellaneous goodies, l 
        like the "can't miss" weapons and 
        such. You've been able to pick up 
        all of these weapons elsewhere, 
        but this is a great chance to com- 
        plete your collection if you 
        missed one or two along the way- 
        this is your only opportunity to 
        buy them. It's also fun to check 
        in on those wacky shopkeepers 
        in El-Junon's 3-story building.

        There's also a really stupid glitch here you can enjoy. First you'll need to go to the Chocobo Ranch and buy a Chocobo stable, 
        which is now for sale. Next, round up a Chocobo, any one will do. Once you've captured him, ride him into Highwind, and he'll 
        automatically be placed into Highwind's Chocobo room. Now fly on over to Rocket Town, and park Highwind near the rocket 
        itself. Get out, and you'll automatically be riding your Chocobo. Since this Chocobo is now somewhat tame, you can leave him 
        and he won't run away. So ride him right into the midst of the rocket in Rocket Town (this won't cause you to automatically enter 
        the town), then disembark. Now try to get back on the Chocobo... It may take quite a few tries, but if the Chocobo is sufficient- 
        ly tangled-up in the rocket platform, you may end up taking control of the rocket, or even the rocket platform instead! Now you 
        can do all sorts of fun things, like, urn... You can take it over to Utai and pretend that they have a rocket! Ha ha! Wee! Okay, I 
        told you it was stupid. Now hit that reset button, 'cause there's no way to turn back. Hope you saved first!

        i First, head on over to this guy's house, located 
        /j| in the eastern 
        i side of Icicle 
        I area, for some 
        tips on how to 
        get the best 
        Chocobos... He 
        I remembers 
        new tips regularly, so stop by often! And if you 
        search his green Chocobo, you'll get another 
        Enemy Skill Materia. 
        
        Cactuer Island 
        
        The half-cactus, half-pickle enemies from Final 
        Fantasy VI now have their own island, located 
        due South of Cosmo Canyon! These little 
        fellers are quick, dangerous, hard to hit, and 
        give you almost nothing in return... Unless you 
        use Morph! 
        
        Yep, up until now Morph Materia has pretty 
        much completely sucked. But if you Morph a 
        Cactuer, he'll turn into a Tetra Elemental, one 
        of the best accessories in the game. These 
        things siphon damage from fire, lightning, ice and earth damage... It's like 
        wearing all of the rings (except for water) at once! t/t 
        Unfortunately, getting it is a bit trickier than it sounds. Cactuers have 6000 
        HP, and a Morph'ed attack against them prob- 
        I ably isn't going to do more than 100-200 points 
        against them. So knock them down to a few 
        hundred HP or so with heavy attacks (Use 
        Sense to find out their current HP status, and 
        then press select so you can continue to mon- 
        itor it), and then have 
        I everyone else guard and 
        i heal while a character 
        I with a no-miss weapon 
        (like Vincent's 255 accu- 
        racy Sniper-CR) Morphs 
        one repeatedly. It's a lot 
        I of trouble, but it's worth 
        it! 
        
        
        
        
        
        I Goblin Island is 
        I actually a string 
        
        
        
        
        of three islands 
        that are just 
        Northeast of 
        Midgar Area. 
        There's 
        absolutely 
        nothing of 
        interest here, 
        except for the 
        Goblin enemies 
        that appear 
        occasionally in 
        the island's one 
        forested area. 
        Not only do 
        these guys exclusively possess one of the 
        game's lamer enemy skills, they also have spe- 
        cial Zeio Nuts that Chocobo raisers will find 
        very valuable. These seeds cannot be found 
        anywhere else! 
        
        Their skill is called Goblin Punch, and it's a 
        weak little technique that just causes the caster 
        to run up and punch a single foe for a small 
        amount of damage. The catch is that if your 
        level is the same as your target's, it does con- 
        siderably more damage (unfortunately, this 
        happens very rarely). Since it's free to cast, it's 
        a pretty good deal on the rare occasions when I 
        you're dealing with enemies of the same level, I 
        suppose.

        This hyper-active women (who appears in every Mideel 
        shop) has made a Chocobo collar out of one of the game's 
        most powerful Materia, which holds four powerful damage- 
        dealing spells. You'll have to befriend the Chocobo to get it, 
        which means feeding it some Mimett Grass (available at the 
        Chocobo Ranch for 1500 each) and rubbing it in just the right 
        place (behind the ears). Try rubbing it elsewhere, just for 
        fun... Hit it in the wrong spots and the cute little guy will turn 
        on you! Once you've liberated the materia, you now have 1 
        new spell for each Materia level... Each hits one target for 
        obscene amounts of damage.

        The Easy Way (Recommended): 
        
        Do absolutely nothing. 
        Pump the time counter

        I and then wait for the first 
        i enemy to rush the fort. 
        You'll automatically go 
        into the boss battle, 
        | where you'll have to face 
        one Softball boss. Kill him quickly and effortlessly 
        by smacking him with two or three meteors or some- 
        thing. Not only will you 
        receive the same Huge 
        Materia that the suckers 
        who actually plan a strat- 
        egy get, you'll also get an 
        Imperial Guard, one of 
        the best armors 
        in the game, 
        from killing the 
        boss. There is 
        absolutely no 
        downside to 
        beating this 
        scene the easy 
        way. Plus, you 
        get the armor!

        Shinra is launching their final assault 
        on Condor Fort, with their eyes on the 
        Huge Materia contained within. Cloud 
        and crew aren't quite sure what they'd 
        do with such a thing, but if Shinra wants 
        it, you probably want it more. So it's off 
        to Condor Fort to head up the defense 
        in Condor Fort's last stand (you can do 
        this scene before or after you do the 
        Corel Mountain huge materia scene). 
        There are two ways you can go about winning this fight. 
        
        The Hard Way: 
        
        Plan and execute a strategy capable of . 
        thwarting the scores upon scores of invaders '* 
        Shinra is sending, by expending your own 
        funds to purchase troops and defensive | 
        machinery. Here's my strategy: 
        
        Since this is the last fight, the most power- 
        ful defensive weapons have been developed, I 
        including the Tristoners. Set these up at the 
        mouths of the four paths that lead to the top | 
        of the mountain. Start the game without buy- 
        ing any troops. 
        
        Wait until the Shinra troops get close, and I 
        you can tell which way they're going to head 
        (they won't always attack in the direction they 
        came from, so wait until the very last minute 
        to make your judgment). Purchase the kind 
        of troops that are most effective against that 
        type of creature, since the enemies usually 
        come in same-type waves. Set them as close I 
        to the traps as you can, except in the case of 
        the projectile-firing enemies, in which case | 
        you'll need to rush them. 
        
        After the first round, continue to replenish I 
        your troops based on the needs of the | 
        moment. Don't let the enemies drive you too 
        far back... If they destroy your traps, replace them. Don't mess around 
        with healers and stuff... You don't have time for defensive measures. If 
        you can react to enemy movements quickly, this battle becomes one of 
        resources, and as long as you have the money to purchase the troops you 
        need, you should be able to survive the seemingly endless waves of ene- 
        mies that will be attacking you for the next ten to twenty minutes.

        you more than a minute or so) you'll have to battle your way 
        through four or five enemies atop the train's rear car to make 
        it to the engine. Kill them quickly- the clock won't stop for 
        battles. If you're looking to collect all of the items in the 
        game, and feel you can afford to dawdle for a while (leave a 
        minute or two for the final battle, and stopping the train), 
        you'll probably want to try stealing the Warrior Bangle from 
        the Eagle Gun. Although it has both a very high defense 
        value and gives you a good attacking bonus, its complete 
        lack of Materia-raising ability makes it kind of a loser. Still, 
        this is the only place you can get it! 
        
        When you get to the engine, it won't be clear how exactly 
        to stop the train, but Cid'H figure something out. Doing this 
        in ten minutes should be no problem! You might want to 
        save first so you can see what happens if you fail, though... 
        
        
        
        
        
        If You Succeed: 
        
        Two exciting prizes await 
        those who successfully stop 
        the train. First, there's the 
        shiny thing from the well 
        that the boy has finally 
        "fished out for you... It's 
        $if «Hw8ralr Ultima, the king of all attack 
        
        spells! (note that you can't actually use it until it's level 
        2). Second is Barret's level 4 limit break. You'll have to 
        go into the house on the west hill, and talk to the 
        woman. She'll give you Catastrophe for free. Good job 
        so far... That's two huge materia down, and two still to 
        come. But first you'll need to return to Mideel, to see 
        how Cloud and Tifa are doing. 
        
        
        
        
        
        
        If You Pail: 
        
        If you make it onto the Shinra train but 
        * run out of time. North Corel is destroyed 
        i again in a different FMV scene. If you did- 
        n't even make it to the Shinra train, the 
        train scene does not happen, and you are 
        forever unable to get the Ultima Materia. 
        
        
        
        You can, however, still 
        get the Ultima material if 
        you allowed the town to be 
        destroyed- The boy in the 
        train's last car will sell it to 
        you, for the low, low price 
        of 50,000 gil.

        Very little has changed with 
        Cloud and Tifa, but Mideel is 
        suddenly being beset by 
        earthquakes, and an untimely 
        visit from Ultimate Weapon. 
        
        Heal up and save your | 
        game before you even go in, 
        because a fairly tough boss I 
        is waiting for you, and you 
        don't want to get caught 
        unprepared.

        Tifa and Cloud included.

        Ultimate Weapon isn't very strong on 
        defense, and his attacks are usually 
        undefendable as well. So the key in 
        this fight is to hit hard, hit fast, and 
        use all of your fun new spells. While 
        Ultimate Weapon can do a ton of dam- 
        age, you can send him running after 
        only one or two turns of Comet, 
        Ultima, and Contain spells. Don*t 
        worry... you'll meet again.

        When Cloud washes up, 
        he'll find himself in a very different Mideel. All of the shops are still open, if you can find them... 
        Most important is the weapon shop, which sells the best weapons you can buy at this point in the 
        game. It seems that that crazy Chocobo woman finally bought all of the shop's stock, and is sell- 
        ing it herself from the house on the ledge in the upper left. You can't see it from the main part 
        of town, so you'll have to jump there from the mossy rock pictured on the right. 
        
        Two Huge Materia remain, and now Cloud is back leading the hunt. As Cait Sith will inform 
        you, the first is in the Undersea Reactor off the coast of Junon. You can get there through the 
        previously blocked Junon elevator, shown in the lower right.

        Materia, or any of the other goodies that are being given

        The route to the Undersea Reactor is 
        very straightforward, as is the 
        Reactor itself. The series of tunnels 
        can be beaten in only a few minutes, 
        but you might want to pause for a 
        while and enjoy some of the fauna 
        lurking in the two screen-long under- 
        water tunnel. One of my favorite 
        enemies appears exclusively in this 
        location: The Ghost Ship pictured to 
        the right. He's easy to miss, so you 
        may want to wander for a bit down 
        here before you take the elevator 
        into the Reactor itself. 
        
        Once you actually enter the 
        Reactor (the enemies for this 
        section are listed on the fac- 
        ing page), it's a short trek to 
        where the Huge Materia is 
        located. But first you'll have 
        to pursue it to the submarine 
        dock, where an incredibly 
        challenging boss awaits...

        The mass of guards swarming the submarine sure seem to be 
        rush, but believe me, they're not going anywhere. Go ahead and 
        take the time to open the two chests scattered here... One of 
        | them contains the Leviathan Scales, a hey item (see box below). 
        
        Once you board the submarine, 
        I save your game and head for the con- 
        | trol room. You'll have the option of 
        killing the crew or taking them pris- 
        1 oner... This option will occur a few 
        more times if you lose the submarine battle, and has no bearing 
        on the rest of the game. Spare their miserable lives, or crush 
        them like the lowly Shinra insects that they are. It's up to you.

        The submarine game is quite easy, once you get used to it. Read 
        the controls carefully, and maybe start the game to take it for a 
        test spin before you reset and load your saved game to do it for 
        real. The trick is not to be deceived by the huge map and the fact 
        that you're given ten minutes to complete your mission. It seems 
        that they want you to play a drawn-out game of cat and mouse 
        with the Shinra sub, but that's a foolhardy strategy. Time is defi- 
        nitely not on your side. 
        
        Instead, hit hard and fast. You begin the game facing the red 
        Shinra submarine that's your target, and you should never let it 
        get out of your sight. Position yourself behind and slightly above 
        it, and fire a constant stream of torpedoes. Wherever it goes, fol- 
        low, making sure never to lose your key firing position. Ignore 
        its entourage of yellow submarines... They will hit you repeated- 
        ly, but you can damage the red sub faster than they can damage 
        you, and since you have roughly equivilant life totals, that means 
        an easy victory for you within only a minute or two of play. 
        
        
        
        If You Succeed: 
        
        If you win, Shinra's sub- 
        marine is downed in the 
        middle of the ocean, and 
        you get to keep the grey 
        one. Note that you will 
        not actually get the Huge 
        Materia... You'll have to 
        return underwater to 
        recover it from the 
        sunken Shinra sub (sim- 
        ply by touching it with 
        your sub) later on, as 
        shown here.

        Enter: Emerald Weapon 
        
        Those who chose to ignore the task before them and instead go exploring the ocean floor may 
        find something interesting lurking around. It's Emerald Weapon, one of the new fightable 
        Ancient Weapons in the American version of Final Fantasy VII. Emerald Weapon just sort of 
        swims around, not hurting anyone, until someone like you decides to push their luck and smash 
        into him. Try it... I don't mean to put too fine a point on it, but he's gonna kick your butt so hard 
        it'll be sore for months. Tougher than even the last boss, it'll take extreme measures to kill this 
        fellow. Since you don't even really get anything for it, I've put Emerald and Ruby Weapon in the 
        Optional Quest section (Appendix A), and I encourage you to check it out much, much later. 
        
        
        
        As usual, your arrival in lunon comes just a bit too late, as the 
        plane is already on the runway. Hmmm... If they had such a cool 
        plane why did they send Rufus to Costa Del Sol by boat? Why 
        did they want Cid's crappy Tiny Bronco so badly? Well, I suppose 
        I that's not really the issue here. What is important is that the final 
        I Huge Materia is on that airplane, and it's heading for Rocket 
        | Town, and from there into deep space, never to return. 
        
        The action's all going on at the rocket platform, where you'll 
        have to fight a few waves of plain old Shinra guardsmen, and 
        then stomp their leader, Rude (if you haven't hit the two new 
        treasure chests in the town itself, now what be a good time). 
        Rude and the guards are a snap, but once you get inside, you'll be 
        locked aboard and blasted into space, a situation you can easily 
        escape from by employing the ship's escape pod. First, though, 
        you have to get that Huge Materia... The puzzle here is a particu- 
        larly tricky one, as the clues are given out completely at random. 
        So even if you are quick and clever enough to process the clues 
        and eliminate all of the wrong passwords within three minutes, 
        you might still end up without enough information to make the 
        right decision. AH of the clues are below, but if you don't like 
        puzzles and want to skip right to the answer, you can find it in 
        the bottom right hand corner of this page. Try to avoid cheat- 
        ing if you can... It makes Cid suspicious. 
        
        1. The third was X. 
        
        2. The second wasn't X.

        4. The last one was ▲ or X. 
        
        5. • was only used once. 
        
        6. ▲ was not used at all.

        Yep, there's a new rule: 
        From this point on, 
        always steal from Turks! 
        They have great stuff. 
        Other than that, have fun 
        with him. There's noth- 
        ing he can do to you.

        same Rude you fought 15 or 
        20 hours ago! The only strat- 
        egy here is to not accidental-

        Even if you do liberate the 
        Huge Materia, it seems to 
        make absolutely no differ- 
        ence. There's still a big explo- 
        sion, and everyone still talks 
        as if the Shinra plan of blow- 
        ing up the meteor with Huge 
        Materia was successful. 
        Whatever!

        1 . Visit Bugenhagen in Cosmo Canyon. 
        
        2. Get Bahamut ZERO from the Huge 
        Materia. 
        
        2. Return to the Forgotten City. 
        
        3. Use the submarine to search for the 
        Key of the Ancients. 
        
        Items/Skills/Materia 
        
        
        
        Well, all that Huge Materia 
        craziness is finally over, 
        but it sure didn't seem to 
        do much good. The mete- 
        or remains, Sephiroth is 
        presumably still around, 
        and you are now com- 
        pletely out of leads. It's 
        time to go running bach to 
        Cosmo Canyon and talh to 
        Bugenhagen again. 
        
        The question he pre- 
        sents is interesting... What 
        was Aerith doing, anyway? 
        After stashing your Huge 
        Materia at his place (don't 
        forget to get Bahamut 
        ZERO!), you're off to the 
        Forgotten City again. A 
        visit to that mysterious 
        bulb in the giant mountain 
        chamber reveals a few 
        hints, and a keyhole, while 
        a vaguely worded clue 
        refers you to a hey in a 
        place that sunlight cannot 
        reach. Lifce, underwater, 
        perhaps? 
        
        
        
        Hop into your sub and head 
        North from Junon. Hug the 
        Eastern wall and eventually 
        you'll come to the crach pic- 
        tured on the left. Continue 
        straight, and you'll see a path 
        that appears to end in a dead 
        end. But heep going and turn 
        to the right, and you'll see that 
        there's actually a tunnel 
        through the rocfe... And it 
        leads right to the hey you 
        need! 
        
        
        
        We'll return to the quest at 
        hand in just a few pages, 
        but as long as you're here 
        underwater, there are two 
        other optional locations 
        that offer incredible 
        rewards for those who can 
        meet their challenges. 
        We'll explore those next. 
        
        
        
        The Secrets of the 
        Huge Materia 
        
        
        
        Irj y~-Afrjy^ You spend hours risking life 
        ■i i and limb to recover these 
        
        ^t^jKL.jrg^^^^z^y^KQ Huge Materia, and all they 
        "^^S'^I^^Sp^^^^R' '' seem to ^° ' s s ' 1 aroun£ l an< l 
        ' ! WtMK^^"'' shimmer. While they don't 
        yt#H<tm -}ft m '■ ' really come into play in any 
        ~ "nWfc " V major way storyline-wise, 
        each Huge Materia has within it a normal sized Materia of 
        incredible power. If you examine the blue one, for example, 
        and currently possess both Bahamut call spells, you'll get the 
        third and final Bahamut call spell, a nasty little call spell 
        called Bahamut ZERO. 
        
        And if you think that's cool, wait 'til you see what the other 
        three Materia do! These "Master" series Materia allow you to 
        cast just about every single spell in that Materia type (green, 
        yellow, or red) with no handicaps, and only one Materia slot! 
        Imagine having every call spell at your disposal without any 
        HP loss! But there is one tiny little catch... To get them you 
        have to have every applicable spell at the Master level, mak- 
        ing them nearly impossible for the casual gamer to get. But if

        Past the same crevasse that took you to the Key of the Ancients lies yet another obscured 
        path. This time, go left as you first enter, and watch for a small opening a little ways above 
        the ground. This tunnel eventually leads to a bright little grot- 
        to. If you return to the surface here, you'll end up in the cir- 
        cular pool here in the heart of the main western continent. 
        
        You can disembark from your sub in the small cliff pictured I 
        in the lower left, and wander around. There appears to be | 
        nothing, but if you look behind the waterfall, you'll find a mys- 
        terious, empty cave, where someone calls out Sephiroth's | 
        name. 
        
        
        
        That is, if Vincent isn't in 
        your party. If he is, he'll 
        immediately reckonize the 
        voice of his lost love, 
        Lucretsia, and the ensuing 
        event will finally reveal the 
        secrets of Vincent's dark past 
        ] and current physical form. 
        
        And more importantly, if 
        you return here a short while 
        later, you'll find Vincent's 
        best weapon and level 4 limit 
        break! Remember, you actu- 
        ally have to go here first and 
        go through the event, then 
        leave and come back a while 
        later to go get the items. If 
        ' you return after having 
        explored the next area (the Downed Shinra Plane) both 
        items should be waiting! 
        
        I Right after the subma- 
        rine battle, you inter- 
        cepted a message that 
        a Shinra plane carry- 
        ing weapons to use 
        against Sephiroth 
        went down in the 
        ocean. That wasn't 
        just talk... It's really 
        here! The weapons it 
        contains are incredible, but the plane was also 
        equipped with a biotechnology lab, and the crea- 
        tures it contained are every bit as powerful as the 
        weapons those creatures are now protecting. 
        
        The enemies in this area are the most powerful 
        ones outside of the final dungeon, so I recommend 
        this quest for those with a strong party and a lot of 
        confidence. Otherwise, you might want to wait until 
        after the next area, when you'll be stronger. 
        
        The crash site is most easily located above water. 
        It's inside the small peninsula jutting up from the 
        east coast of Gold Saucer Area.

        The enemies here are I 
        incredibly brutal, so you'll 
        need to be at your strategic 
        best. Luckily, you've picked 
        up a few items that can make j 
        this part significantly easier. 
        
        One is the Ribbon. This | 
        king of all accessories protects you from all enemy condi- 
        tions. Since this area's two strongest enemies both use con- 
        ditional magic (one uses confuse the other poison), your 
        Ribbons will allow you to make two of your characters (if 
        you have both Ribbons) immune to the worst of their 
        attacks. These characters should also be the ones holding 
        heal, treat, and revive magics, so they can save whoever's left 
        without one. 
        
        Equally valuable is the Gravity materia. It hasn't been too 
        useful up to this point, but now that you're facing enemies 
        with over 10,000 HP, a well timed blast from this materia is 
        your most powerful source of damage. 
        
        Oh, and note the wide variety of armor you can steal from 
        these guys. It's difficult, but if you take the risk, you can get 
        some pretty nice stuff- 
        As you explore, take care not to miss the Hades materia 
        hidden near the helicopter in the cargo room, and the 
        Double Cut Materia (an incredibly useful tool!) hidden in the 
        corners of the lower level of the laboratory. It's possible to 
        miss the laboratory entirely if you don't recognize the door 
        in the main corridor... It's not very well marked. The items 
        here include Yuffie's best weapon, the best armor in the 
        game (in my opinion), and a new Cloud Weapon.

        After Bugenhagen slides the bey into the slot, the game's final chapter begins. Your 
        goal is now clear: Recover that Holy Materia, somehow, and use it to destroy the 
        ever-closer Meteor. But just as you set foot outside the 
        j Forgotten City to begin your quest, another pesky Weapon 
        decides to mix things up a bit. There's nothing you can do 
        i but watch from Highwind as he waddles towards Midgar... 
        ; When he arrives, you'll need to land near Midgar and run 
        j towards him to get things going again. 
        
        Afterwards, return to Highwind and head North to the 
        crater to survey the damage... The route to the final dun- 
        ■ geon is finally clear, but that nutty Hojo still has his finger 
        on the trigger of the Sister Ray, and if he fires again, the 
        ' effects could be disastrous. So it's back to Midgar you go, 
        i one last time, to put an end to this Hojo situation for good. 
        
        But before you enter Midgar's Sector 8, why not enjoy a 
        I quick trip down memory lane by dropping in on Midgar's 
        good 'ol Section 6 Slums? 
        
        
        
        
        
        Boss Strategies 
        
        Diamond Weapon is tough on defense, 
        but fairly weak on offense, so you can 
        take this one nice and stow. Just smash 
        him with various attack spells until he 
        opens his chest, which is your cue to A) 
        start hitting him with regular attacks 
        and saved up limit breaks, and B) brace 
        yourself for his one incredibly power- 
        ful attack. If you're strong enough to 
        survive that attack, DW will be an easy 
        kill. Don't forget to steal Rising Sun, a 
        double-AP Yuffie weapon.

        game. But shortly after the beginning of the second disc, this v 
        fellow appears outside the door. He seems to have lost his key... And if you talk to him a few ~g-*Ji 
        times, he'll reveal where: at the archeological tour in Bone Village! • _ 
        
        I lead back (d Bone Village and have them excavate for Normal Items. It may take a few tries, mJjgJNk 
        but eventually they will come up with the key item "Section 6 Key." With this you can open the 
        door and return to a small section of Midgar including Section 6 and the Wall Market. 
        
        
        
        
        
        You may notice Ultimate Weapon 
        (details on page 90) lurking over 
        this crater near Junon. You can 
        begin pursuing him, but it might 
        not be possible to complete the 
        event now, since he may fly over 
        Midgar after your first battle (pur- 
        suing him there would automati- 
        cally start the next scene). 
        
        
        
        Tifa's Best Weapon, Aerith's Ghost, and More! 
        
        Feels like years since you've last been here, doesn't it? Surprisingly little has changed... But 
        there are three things worth doing while you're here. First, visit that old church for a mysti- 
        cally poignant moment. Next, head up to the Wall Market, and go into that one room with the 
        computer and the ceiling-mounted gattling gun. It won't shoot you this time, allowing you to 
        go to the computer and get "Premium Heart," Tifa's best weapon. Finally, you can purchase the 
        accessory "Sneak Glove" from the guy you bought the batteries from. It's supposed to help 
        you steal, but the only one stealing anything is the shopkeeper with his 129,000 gil price tag.

        This four-part dungeon begins I 
        as soon as Highwind flies over 
        Midgar, so make sure you pre- 1 
        pare yourself beforehand. 
        This is not a particularly long I 
        dungeon, but it can tire you I 
        down, and a series of difficult | 
        enemies await you at the end. 
        
        There are a number of excit- 
        ing treasures here, including 
        
        Barret's most powerful weapon and the W-Item Materia. And 
        although it's easy to miss, a small ventilation shaft in this tun- 
        nel is the one and only route bach into the Shinra building, 
        where even more powerful goods await (including Cait Sith's 
        most powerful weapon). Explore this area of Midgar thor- 
        oughly, as you'll never have another opportunity to return 
        (you can, however, return to the Block 6 slums at any time by 
        using the trick outlined on the facing page). 
        Your goal in the first part of the dungeon is the door on 
        You can get here fairly directly by taking route 1-3-4-6-7, 
        
        
        
        the top map that's marked #7 
        but if you want all the items, you'll have to cross between the two maps a few more times 
        first. Fortunately, the enemies here aren't so difficult. Just watch out for the character- 
        confusing Crazy Saws.

        When you enter the tun- 
        nel complex, you can go 
        one of two ways. The way 
        to get to the Sister Ray 
        and Shinra building is to 
        run away from the screen, 
        inwards. It's only a few 
        screens away, just past the 
        Turks. 
        
        But if you head the 
        other way, towards the 
        screen, you'll find an 
        incredibly long series of 
        identical maps that culmi- 
        nates in a dead end... and 
        the W-Item materia.

        they're still willing to give you a

        member is the Turks' |j ffiTTVI

        The route leading towards the screen 
        from the ventilation shaft is long and 
        tedious. While it's impossible to get 
        lost, (the left side of the forking tun- 
        nels are always blocked) the Shadow 
        Makers that prowl the area are 
        incredibly annoying. While they're 
        only dangerous when paired with 
        Crazy Saws, their ability to slow down 
        your party makes the fights in this 
        area take an unbearably long time... 
        I'd recommend just dispatching them 
        with powerful mass-kill magic spells, 
        since you can always use a tent at the 
        save spot at the end. 
        
        The chests on the way contain a 
        complete set of the various 
        "Sources," which is nothing much to 
        write home about. The materia at the 
        very end, W-Item, does have some 
        interesting uses. It lets you use two 
        items at once, allowing you to, say, fol- 
        low a Phoenix Down with an X-Potion 
        before your enemy has 
        a chance to kill the 
        newly revived party 
        member. Still, if you 
        don't want to take the 
        walk now, you can get it 
        from Bone Village on 
        disc 3 (see page 89).

        Once you've fought Hojo, there's no returning to this area, so 
        if you want to raid the Shinra Building, you'll have to do it 
        now. To get there, go North from the entrance, and ignore 
        the left fork that leads you out I 
        of the tunnels and into the city 
        blocks where the Sister Ray is [ 
        being housed. 
        
        Instead, head to the right, 
        and then take the left route at I

        ventilation shaft, and there you

        the five parts can 
        attack, it may be worth 
        it to destroy all of the 
        parts individually, 
        instead of simply trying to deal 
        10,000 points to the body 
        before it can finish off your 
        party. Powerful call spells are 
        your best bet, but be ready 
        with a few powerful follow-up 
        attacks if they're unable to fin- 
        ish the job (Trine, pictured to 
        the left, is a particularly effec- 
        tive and affordable enemy 
        skill against enemies who are 
        weak to lightning). Make sure 
        you save at the save point as soon as you get here, 'cause 
        with a couple of high rolls in a row, the Panzer can kill any- 
        body. 
        
        You'll want to put Barret 
        in your party as you climb 
        the stairway to the Sister 
        Ray... The chest pictured 
        here, containing Barret's 
        strongest weapon, the 
        Missing Score, won't even 
        appear if Barret isn't in 
        your group. 
        
        
        
        There's only one enemy in the middle map pictured on the 
        left, but it's more dangerous than some of the bosses 
        you're going to face! The Gross Panzer is made up of five 
        separate parts, totalling around 20,000 HP (only stats for

        Disc Three 
        Area Updates 
        
        
        
        
        
        You'll miss the final Cosmo 
        Canyon event if you don't go visit 
        one last time, with Red-XIII in 
        your party. 
        
        
        
        The overworld, towns and villagers seem basically unchanged as 
        you enter Disc 3. The only new area this disc contains is the final 
        dungeon, which you can enter immediately after clearing Midgar. 
        You can always leave again once you've checked everything out, 
        but it makes sense to go searching for the last few strongest 
        weapons and level 4 limit breaks now. 
        
        Quick recap: You should have found Barret's strongest 
        weapon near the Sister Ray, and his limit break back in North 
        Corel. Tifa's limit break was in Nibelheim, and her strongest 
        weapon was back in Midgar's Sector 6. Cid's strongest weapon 
        was in Rocket Town, and his limit break was in the downed Shinra plane. Cait Sith's strongest 
        weapon was in the Shinra building, and he has no level 4 limit break. Both of Yuf He's items were 
        in Utai, and both of Vincent's were in Lucretsia's cave. Cloud's limit break can be won in Gold 
        Saucer's battle square, and we'll get his best weapon on the next page, from Ultimate Weapon. 
        That leaves Red-XIII... You should have gotten Cosmo Memory M^jfCSX\^^^^S9Bt^d 
        eons ago in the Shinra Mansion, and now you can finally get his fFWsS^tkS^^^^^rT 1 
        best weapon, Limited Moon. ■ » * •» 
        
        To get Limited Moon, return to Cosmo Canyon any time in Disc 1 
        3, and speak with Bugenhagen while Red-XIII is in your party. | 
        You'll see a new event and get the weapon. 
        
        There's only one other major change in Disc 3, and that's in I 
        Bone Village. Here, sloppy gamers have one last chance to pick 
        up a few items they've missed along the way. Did you blow the 
        Condor Fort event? You can excavate Phoenix, and even the | 
        Huge Materia now. Didn't get Bahamut ZERO? It's here. Figured It may take a few tries, but the 
        the W-Item Materia wasn't worth the trip? You can get it, and a Bone Village crew can excavate all 
        few other items from areas that are now permanently closed, by sort s of great items in disc 3. 
        excavating them now in Disc 3.

        I The Ancient Forest is one of the best hidden areas in Final 
        Fantasy VII. Not only is it full of cool items like the Tupon 
        call spell and the Apocalypse sword, it's also possible to 
        I get to it relatively early in the game. 
        
        As soon as you get Highrwind, you can begin the process 
        I of Chocobo Raising... A simple Mountain Chocobo is all it 
        tabes to get up here, and all that's stopping you from get- 
        ting a ton of powerful weapons are some reasonably chal- 
        j lenging enemies and a few 
        
        tricby puzzles. 
        
        But if you didn't do the Chocobo Raising thing, your 
        first opportunity to challenge the forest comes after 
        Ultimate Weapon's destruction creates a crater allowing 
        you access to this mountaintop location. 
        
        
        
        
        The Ancient Forest is unlike any other dungeon you've 
        visited. It consists of only 4 straight left-to-right maps 
        (and a small cave at the end). To progress, you'll have to 
        picb up bugs and frogs and use them in clever ways. And 
        if you fail at that, it's possible to get completely stucb, 
        forcing you to press O and end the dungeon prematurely 
        (you can always try again, but from the beginning). The 
        later puzzles can be tough, but as long as you beep your 
        eyes open and try all the options, you should do fine.

        The first map is pretty much just basic training... There are really only two puzzles here. The first 
        is the snapping flower at the bottom (chech your health... These things do damage!). To sneab in and 
        grab the treasure, you'll have to use the frog as bait, dropping it at the spot shown in the top picture. 
        As long as he's there, you can sneab in and grab it safely. Vincent's Supershot ST is yours. 
        
        Gather together all three insects and bring them near the hanging flower-things in the middle of 
        the map. If you use them near the flowers, you'll toss the bugs into the flowers, mabing them snap 
        shut and allowing you to pass over until the bug is digested. This doesn't tabe long, so mabe sure all 
        your bugs are collected and ready to go! 
        
        The flower vine on the right is easily crossed... lust jump onto the hang- 
        ing part and jump over the crevasse. 
        
        Note that feeding the hanging flowers a frog instead of a bug will cause 
        them to vomit out the frog, sending Cloud flying. This is an important tac- 
        tic on Map 2, as the force of the expulsion will send you to areas you 
        couldn't otherwise get to, such as to the hive located to the left here (pic- 
        ture on the right), or over the giant snapping flower on the right, allowing 
        you to progress further into the forest.

        Use the frog tricb outlined last page to get the 
        hive located above and to the right of the 
        snapping flower on the left. Give the flower 
        that to chew on, and you can grab the sweet 
        Slash All Materia it guards. 
        
        To get the Minerva Bracelet located at the 
        base of the tree on the right, you'll need to 
        jump there from the bottom of the next map. 
        Note that you can't jump bacfe up. 
        
        
        
        
        
        4* 
        
        
        
        
        Use two bugs on the hanging flowers to create the path to the top map, where you'll find Tupon wait- 
        ing at the far right. To get this baffling call spell, simply jump across the three suspended flowers. 
        
        Next you'll have to head bach down route 3 to get past the final forest map's difficult puzzle. You'll j 
        need to use every single one of the four bugs to solve this... First, use one to get the hive, and then i 
        - feed that to the snapping flower, opening the route to the left, bacfe to 
        the main part of the map. Use the second bug to activate that hanging ' 
        flower, and now you can reclaim the two bugs on the left you used to get 1 
        I up to the treetop map. Here's the tricfey part... Drop one of the bugs out- 
        I side of the hole in the tree, luring out the frog hiding in there. Tafee the frog" 1 
        j back to the hanging flower in the middle, but don't feed him to the flower! Go j 
        grab the final bug, and use that to re-activate the flower. Then grab the i 
        frog and jump across. Finally, use the frog on the hanging flower in the | 
        I far right... When the flower coughs it up, you'll land at the entrance 
        ■ to the cave that contains the 
        j Apocalypse Sword. 
        
        Anyone trying for the Master 
        I Materia should use this sword | 
        ! constantly... With three materia '

        The final dungeon contains some of the most powerful Materia in the game, the final five 
        enemy skills, and a host of terrifying enemies. There is only one save point in this dungeon, 
        one that you create with the Save Crystal found in the dungeon's first chest. This will make 
        a save point almost anywhere inside, but can only be used once. You'll probably want to save 
        it until the very end. 
        
        A lot of people don't realize that you can actually leave this dungeon once you've entered. 
        Simply exit out the cave in the first screen, and then climb the rocks near the cave's mouth 
        back up to the Highwind. 
        
        Prepare yourself well, for the final 
        battle is at hand! 
        
        Side note: After you spend the night with 
        Tifa before entering the dungeon, she gets 
        horribly embarrassed when the other 
        party members reveal they saw you two 
        together... But the degree to which she 
        gets embarrassed actually changes 
        depending on your number of love 
        points, suggesting that... well, you know.

        First is the Dark 
        Dragon's Dragon Force, an 
        okay defensive magic (it 
        simply raises your defen- 
        sive stats by 50%) that can 
        only target one character. 
        
        The other is Level 5 
        Death, a powerful death 
        spell that the Parasites can 
        cast. Be very careful 
        here... Ribbons and such 
        will not prevent the effect, 
        so this spell could actually 
        wipe out your party, if 
        your levels are all multi- 
        ples of 5. 
        
        
        
        
        Um, if you only did thirteen points 
        of damage to me, then why am I 
        dead? Watch out for these guys... 
        They can kill in a single hit that no 
        accessory can prevent, and do so 
        often. The most dangerous ene- 
        mies in the dungeon, save your 
        strongest spells for them.

        Items/Skills/Materia 
        
        
        
        As you enter this area, head to the left and 
        climb up to the topmost chest. From there, 
        you can go right, sort of behind the back- 
        ground, and pick up the semi-hidden HP 
        Absorb Materia. With the exception of the 
        Megalixir in the cave below, the rest of the 
        chests contain nothing more exciting than a 
        bunch of status up "sources", and are barely 
        | worth going out of your way for. 
        
        If you still want to check them all out, you'll [ 
        have to circle both sides of the first part of the dungeon (note that the right | 
        side is down-only, you can't go back up). 
        
        To get through the dungeon below, you'll have to stay on the right side, and 
        drop down to cave #3. Take that to get down to exit #4, and then just fall down I 
        the rest of the way. If you want to get the chest on the left, or accidentally fall 
        the wrong way, you'll have to take cave entrance #5 to go all the way bach to [ 
        the top. 
        
        
        
        
        Splitting Up Your Party 
        
        
        
        
        I When you drop 
        I down onto the area 
        shown below, Cloud 
        I will have the option 
        | to split up his party, 
        £ sending each raera- 
        \ ber in one of three 
        directions. The two 
        I that accompany 
        Cloud will be your party members for the next 
        part of the dungeon, so chose them wisely. 
        
        You can't control the other parties you cre- 
        ate, but you should make sure to distribute 
        them evenly among the other directions. Each 
        one will pick up one item along the way, and 
        give it to you when you meet up again (Make 
        sure you don't send Yuffie alone, or she'll just 
        pocket whatever she finds). 
        
        i which way should you go? That depends on what your priorities are. The right and left/down routes are both very beau- 
        tiful locations you probably won't want to miss. And the left/up and left/down routes are a bit easier than the right route. All the 
        routes have cool treasures, but you'll get better materia with either of the left routes. The right route, however, has enemies who 
        cast four enemy skills that you may not encounter elsewhere in the dungeon. 
        
        If you have the strength and endurance to handle it, I recommend you do them all (you can always drop the save crystal after 
        the first one to heal and save, and then go back and do the other two). If this is your decision, you should chose the right route 
        initially. Of the three, it's the only one-way route, so you can beat it and then make a loop of the two left routes once you get to 
        the bottom with the right route. You can also take one left route down, the other back up, and then take the right route down at 
        the very end, of course. 
        
        If you do decide to this, you can actually get yourself two copies of some of the items in this dungeon, by picking them up 
        once, and then getting them from your party members (note that if you get them from your party members first, the items will 
        then actually disappear from the maps). To get the good stuff, you'll need to send the right characters in the right directions, 
        bearing in mind that when you send a character l 
        left, you can't further chose whether they go 
        left up or left down unless you take that route 
        with them. 
        
        To get a second Mystile, send Ufa right. For 
        the Shield Materia, send Red-XIII on the left/up 
        route. Yuffie will get the Command Counter 
        Materia if she's sent left/up, and a Megalixir if 
        sent to the Right. Vincent will also get a 
        Megalixir if sent to the right, and the Super 
        Enemy-All Materia if sent left/down. Finally, 
        send Cid on the left/up route to get one more 
        Imperial Guard.

        either up or down from the map 
        on the left. If you don't plan on 
        doing them personally, you'll 
        probably want to send six party

        I Taking the lower path 
        after the divide leads 
        you to this beautiful 
        area, full of wacky ene- 
        mies like Christopher, 
        Ziggy, the Magic Pots, 
        I and Master Tonberi. 
        
        There are some very 
        I interesting items here, 
        too, although it isn't always immediately clear how 
        to get at them. To get to the chests in the second and 
        third maps, you'll need to jump into the water from 
        various areas, such as the one shown here, and swim 
        under the obstacles. 
        
        While Ziggy, Christopher, and the Magic Pots are 
        generally harmless, the Master Tonberis are any- 
        thing but. These little fel- 
        lows can fell pretty much 
        any character with one 
        swing of their lanterns, 
        and can attack much more 
        
        
        
        
        quickly than the standard 
        Tonberi's. As with them, 
        your best bet is to run, or 
        use Exit magic. Those who 
        decide to take their 
        chances and fight it out 
        will no doubt find that the 
        meager rewards definitely 
        do not justify the struggle. 
        
        Magic Pots are a differ- 
        ent matter entirely. These 
        easy-to-kill enemies give 
        you 1 ,000 AP a pop! Ignore 
        their cries for Elixirs... If 
        you give them one, they 
        simply won't steal from 
        you, something that hap- 
        pens only rarely anyways.

        Second: Talk regularly with the 
        Chocobo Sage up in Icicle 
        Area (p. 73). He remembers 
        things about breeding 
        Chocobo mutations periodi- 
        cally, and sells the best vegeta- 
        bles. 
        
        
        
        
        The Basics of Chocobo Breeding 
        
        The ability to not just capture and ride Chocobos, but to actually breed and raise them, is a new 
        twist on the Final Fantasy series' traditional Chocobo system. Chocobo breeding can be incred- 
        ibly time-consuming, but the rewards are incredible... If you begin it as soon as possible, short- 
        ly after first getting Highwind, you can end up with access to five hidden areas (the four Materia 
        Caves shown on the right and the Ancient Forest, which you can get to early with a Mountain 
        Chocobo), and get some of the most powerful Materia in the game relatively early on, when they 
        can really make a difference! For these reasons, I urge you to don some inexpensive footwear 
        and join the exciting world of Chocobo husbandry. 
        
        At first, the possibilities seem non-existant. You can capture Chocobos, feed 'em to raise their 
        stats, then breed them and do the same with their offspring, until you breed a Chocobo cham- 
        pion capable of winning you useless crap in the higher classes of Chocobo racing (prizes listed 
        on page 102). This is not so exciting. But what is exciting is the possibility of breeding Chocobo 
        mutations, capable of climbing mountains and walking on water. These allow you access to 
        areas you simply can't get to with Highwind... Areas where there's no place to land an airship. 
        
        Chocobos captured from different areas vary in quality, which only the Chocobo Ranch peo- 
        ple can assess. You need specific Chocobos (see opposite page, far right) to make specific muta- 
        tions, so I've highlighted where you can find them on the map. But be forewarned: Breeding 
        Chocobos is never a sure bet. What you'll get is random, and even when you follow the instruc- 
        tion to the letter, you might not end up with the one you want... If you don't like what you get, 
        you can send it back: reset to right before you bred the Chocobos and you'll probably get some- 
        thing else. Also, higher class Chocobos will bear the right mutations more frequently, so take 
        your breeding pairs to the Chocobo races and get them up as high as you can... If they're not at 
        least Class A by the time you try to breed the Sea Chocobo, your odds of success are poor. But 
        plan ahead early, because it's all hereditary- If the parents of the Chocobos you plan to breed to 
        get the Sea Chocobo aren't champions, their offspring won't be either. 
        
        To get your Chocobos to a point where they can win consistently at the races, you'll have to 
        feed them well (note that each Chocobo has a maximum capacity of each stat it cannot exceed, 
        but that this maximum will be raised in its offspring). A chart detailing the effects of the vari- 
        ous types of food is on the right... We can learn two major lessons from this: You get what you 
        pay for, and most feed is only effective when you give the Chocobo a whole bunch of it at the 
        same time. Speed and Stamina are self-explanatory, Intelligence (which can't be so easily quan- 
        tified) measures how well the Chocobo can hold a straight-line when it's running, and Tameness 
        seems to alter how quickly the Chocobo responds to Cloud's orders (when you whip it for extra 
        speed, for example).

        take them back to Highwind,

        FFYIPs Two Optional Super Bosses 
        
        [ think it was Final Fantasy V that introduced the concept of incredibly difficult, optional bosses that were 
        I worth nothing more than bragging rights. It takes hours of trying t o beat them, and when you do, all you 
        I get is some completely useless item whose only function is to prove 
        1 that you succeeded where so many others failed. Emerald and 
        Ruby Weapon, two optional Ancient Weapon creatures, seem to be 
        the successor to that trend. Killing them requires you to have a 
        number of hard-to-get Materia at high levels, gets you the apparent- 
        ly useless items "Emerald" and "Ruby," and could take even master 
        players the better part of a day. So what's the point? Well, it's all 
        about being cool. Those who can successfully defeat these two 
        ultra-difficult bosses will find themselves achieving a level of cool _ 
        | that few mortals are even aware exists. It'll be just you, me, and 
        Fonzie from Happy Days up there, doing incredibly cool things like starting jukeboxes with our fists and 
        whatnot. And all that's standing in your way are the two remaining Ancient Weapons... 
        
        Emerald Weapon 
        
        Emerald Weapon can be found swimming around underwater, 
        usually stopping to rest over the underwater crater, or near the 
        sunken Shinra sub and plane. You can begin the fight by smashing 
        into him with your submarine. 
        
        He has 1,000,000 hit points, four independently functioning laser 
        beams that can destroy your MP and HP levels, and a number of 
        special attacks capable of doing 9,999 points of damage to all party 
        members. It's pretty obvious that you're not gonna last long 
        against Emmy, despite the twenty minute counter Square threw in, 
        apparently just to taunt you. So your goal here is simple... Do a 
        million points of damage as quickly as possible. And there's only 
        one practically achievable Materia combo capable of doing all that... 
        
        At most. Knights of the Round can do just under 130,000 points of damage in one turn (your magic lev- 
        els will need to be incredibly high to achieve all of that), but with this combo, even if it does under 80,000 
        points of damage per turn, you'll have a fairly good chance of success. All you need is two Mimic Materia 
        (you're going to have to make the first one reproduce itself), Knights of the Round at level 4 or higher, and 
        the W-Summon materia. Give Knights of the Round and W-Summon to one character, the Mimics to every- 
        one else, and your strategy should be clear: Let the battle run until everyone's time bar is full, have your 
        first party member cast Knights of the Round twice with W-Summon, and then have everyone mimic it to triple the effect. 
        
        Of course, it sounds much easier than it is. Ideally, you could then just skip the original caster's turn and have your two supporting charac- 
        ters continue to mimic it until Emmy dies. But in my experience. Emerald Weapon never lets that happen... He'll slaughter the whole lot of you 
        before the turn is over. So you'll have to somehow return from the dead, a task that can best be accomplished with a Final Attack + Phoenix 
        combo, as discussed in the Materia section. This will return everyone to life, and give you one more chance to do your nasty combo, finishing 
        him off with disturbingly little time to spare (thanks to the incredibly long time Knights of the Round takes to cast). 
        
        When the battle starts, try casting the enemy skill "Big Guard," which will put you all in the Haste condition and give you barriers that should 
        allow you to survive Emmy's attacks until you can get your combo going. Make sure you have a couple of Turbo Ethers and Megalixirs, 'cause if 
        he can get his lasers out, he can end your game quickly by draining the MP from all of your characters. If he can drain the character who holds 
        the Final Attack+Phoenix combo, then it's pretty much all over. Note that in subsequent Emerald Weapon fights, the amount of XP and AP you 
        get varies based on the amount of time it took you to win. 
        
        Ruby Weapon 
        
        At certain times in the game. Ruby Weapon will stick her bright red head up through the sand in the 
        | desert surrounding Gold Saucer. To begin the battle, fly into her with Highwind. 
        
        Compared to Ruby, Emmy's a snap. You'll have to use the same basic strategy here, but things are com- 
        I plicated by the fact that Ruby's initial attacks tend to suck away two random party members, leaving but 
        one character alive to face the challenge. Even worse, Ruby Weapon is completely invulnerable in the 
        early part of the battle, and you'll probably have to waste one cast- 
        ing of Knights of the Round on Ruby's arm stalks, lest they suck 
        away all of your MP. 
        
        You basically have two options here. One is to load up one char- 
        acter with Knights, W-Summon, Mimic, Final Attack + Revive 
        (which requires less MP than Phoenix, and is more efficient if you 
        only have one character), the Shield Materia (it's completely invaluable on this fight), a Ribbon (to prevent 
        the confuse condition Ruby likes to cause), and the Mystile armor (no armor will allow you to survive 
        Ruby's repeated casting of the Ultima spell, but Mystile's high magic evasion rate gives you about a 50/50 
        chance of dodging it). Fight with Ruby over and over again until that character is the lucky one she allows 
        to live, and then get the combo started. You can start hitting Ruby from the moment the stalks appear, 
        although at that point the stalks themselves should be your #1 priority. Cast Shield on yourself to keep 
        your chosen character alive while you pull off the combo, then cast Knights at the stalks once and at Ruby 
        once, mimic it until your shield gives out, then have a Turbo Ether or Elixir and start it over again. Ruby 
        will kill you repeatedly, but you can stand to die once for each level of your Final Attack materia... More 
        than that, and you know what'll happen. The other option is to just keep fighting that red data animal until 
        she allows two or more characters to stay in the fight, something that happens randomly, and not very 
        often. Then use the same basic strategy outlined for Emerald Weapon.

        Most people only stop by the Gold Saucer a few times to 
        take a break from the serious events of the world below. 
        But a few gamers spend hours, even days here... And if 
        you seek 100% of the game's hidden treasures, you'll have 
        to join them. The noteworthy treasures (all exclusive) 
        include Aerith's Umbrella, Cid's powerful Flayer, Cloud's 
        level 4 limit break, and a ton of obscure materia: Speed, 
        Sneak Attach, Enemy Lure, Enemy Away, Pre-Emptive, 
        Magic Counter, Gil Plus, XP Plus, W-Summon, and the 
        legendary Final Attach. 
        
        
        
        There are eight different parts of 
        Gold Saucer, including the Station, 
        Speed Square, Ghost Square, 
        Chocobo Square, Wonder Square, 
        Event Square. Battle Square, and 
        (ha ha) Round Square. 
        
        The main form of currency in 
        Gold Saucer is "GP." If you want to 
        use the save spot, stay at the inn 
        (Ghost Square), or participate in the 
        Shooting Coaster, Duel, or Round 
        Square night tour, you'll need to 
        earn some. 
        
        There are two ways (actually, 
        there are three... see below) to earn 
        GP: One is to play games in Wonder 
        Square, which cost gil to play but 
        can earn you GP. The other is to bet 
        on the Chocobo races at Chocobo 
        Square. You get 10 GP the first time 
        you arrive at Gold Saucer, but 
        you're not given any on subsequent 
        visits. Just to complicate things, the 
        Duel at Battle Square earns you 
        Battle Points, which can't be con- 
        verted to GP. 
        
        The GP you amass can be used to 
        play games such as the Duel or the 
        Shooting Coaster that have their 
        own prizes, or can be redeemed for 
        prizes in the Wonder Square. These 
        prizes pretty much suck- The really 
        good stuff must be won at the 
        Shooting Coaster, the Duel, or at the 
        Chocobo races. 
        
        If you're not into the games, and 
        have a ton of money (try selling 
        some Master level Enemy-All 
        Material. They're worth about a mil- 
        lion gil), you can exploit a little- 
        fenown secret method of buying GP. 
        When you exit out to the station, 
        about one time in eight you'll 
        encounter a shadowy man hidden 
        way in the distance who will sell you 
        up to 100 GP for 100 gil a pop. 
        
        
        
        
        Wonder Square 1 
        
        
        
        
        Arm Wrestling is one of the sim- 
        plest Gold Saucer games. You 
        just hammer on the O button, 
        and if you win, you get 1 GP for 
        Sumo level, and 2 GP for 
        Wrestler level. Barely worth the 
        trouble, it seems. 
        
        But there is one neat trick you 
        can do here, if you have a rapid 
        fire controller. If you're tired of 
        Gold Saucer and just want some 
        free GP, put the O button on auto 
        fire (if it doesn't have this set- 
        ting, put it on rapid fire and wrap 
        a rubber band around your con- 
        troller or something to hold it 
        down). Then turn Cloud so he's 
        facing the Arm Wrestling 
        machine, and put something 
        heavy on the D-pad so he'll keep 
        facing that way. He'll keep play- 
        ing the game, and you'll rack up a 
        couple hundred GP per hour you 
        leave it that way. 
        
        
        
        The UFO Catcher games 
        contain very little of 
        interest. The one on the 
        left has mostly Potions 
        and 1 GP's, although 
        there's about a 1 in 100 
        chance that you'll fish 
        out 80 GP or a Megalixir. 
        Odds aren't any better 
        on the one on the right: 
        You've got about a l in 
        100 chance of getting 100 GP or a normal Elixir, and 
        maybe a 1 in 20 chance of getting (ooh!) Phoenix 
        Down. 
        
        
        
        
        
        
        The timing is the bey. Use Cloud's animation as a guide... 
        I lihe to wait 'til Cloud brings the ball up to that one spike 
        of hair up front (left picture), wait about one half of a sec- 
        ond, and then shoot. If your eyes, nerves, and hands are 
        steady, you'll never miss. 
        
        
        
        If you can successfully master 
        Super Dunk (and anyone can, with 
        enough practice), you'll have 
        access to the quickest way to rack 
        up GP. The way it works is simple: 
        If you make a basket, you get the 
        opportunity to shoot again. If you 
        miss, the game's over and you get 1 
        GP for each shot made. If you 
        make ten in a row, you can play 
        double or nothing (well, next to 
        nothing... You get a 1GP) until you 
        choke, or the machine gives up (at 
        the 300 GP mark). It's all in the tim- 
        ing.

        Games just don't get any more inane than Mog House. 
        My guess is that this game was intended as a parody of 
        that silly Tamagotchi fad. 
        
        Anyway, Mog House may be a bit lacking in terms of 
        fast-paced action, but it is an incredibly easy 30 GP. (The 
        game itself doesn't give you anything... If you win, the girl 
        behind you will give you the 30, but only once). The, um, 
        "trick" is to feed Mog just the right amount. If he looks 
        like he's hungry, feed him. When he looks full- and this 
        is key, people, so pay attention- stop feeding him. You 
        might want to write that down, just to make sure.

        Once you've done the sub mini game in the actual 
        game (late in disc 2), this game will be open for you. 
        Everything operates basically the same, but now there 
        are four new maps and many more enemies to 
        destroy. Whereas before you could safely ignore the 
        yellow submarines, now both yellow and red count 
        equally towards the minimum destruction totals of 8- 
        10 submarines per level. 
        
        With this many enemies to defeat, you're definitely 
        going to need a new 
        strategy. Learn how

        carefully (it alternates between being automatic and 
        manual on different levels) for the mines. 
        The real danger, however, is in running out of time. 
        
        Killing 8-10 subs in 
        only 10:00 can be 
        
        very difficult when Practice reversing into a 3-point turn

        you can rapidly pursue enemies as soon as they 
        appear on your sonar. If you keep your sub high so as 
        to avoid mines, moving around in this mode should be 
        no problem.

        Beneath the unconvincing fight- 
        ing game veneer lies good ol' 
        Rock-Paper-Scissors. Except 
        with one difference- the com- 
        puter cheats. 
        
        And when you're playing 
        Rock-Paper-Scissors against 
        someone who's cheating, well, 
        you haven't got much of a 
        chance. So I recommend you 
        stay far, far away from this little 
        mini-"game." If you get really 
        lucky, you'll get 3GP for your 200 
        gil, but odds are you'll end up 
        with nothing. 
        
        If you lose to the first enemy 
        (odds are actually rigged in your 
        favor), you get nothing. If you 
        lose to the second enemy (odds 
        are pretty much even), you get 
        nothing. If you lose to the third 
        enemy (odds are way against 
        you) you get 3 GP. And in the 
        extremely unlikely event that 
        you beat him and get to the 
        fourth enemy (I actually played 
        this mini-"game" for six whole 
        hours, non-stop, trying to get his 
        picture, and never did, which is 
        perhaps why I'm just a tad bit- 
        ter), you get 30 GP. 
        
        Is there a fifth enemy? 
        Nobody knows. In the whole his- 
        tory of mankind, no one's ever 
        beaten the fourth. It's probably 
        not possible.

        Wonder Square 2 (continued) 
        
        
        
        Now this is more like it! G-Bike is my favorite mini game of 'em all, and is a hell of a lot 
        more fun than the vast majority of real racing games on the PlayStation. There's actually a 
        lot of strategy to it, too, at least on this version. 
        
        For one thing, you have to watch your score. You get 10GP if and only if your score 
        exceeds 10,000 points... You get 500 points for each bike you take down, but you lose 50 for 
        each time they hit the truck (it flashes white). Since your points can go down extremely 
        quickly, make protecting the truck your top priority. Stay with it, high on the screen, and 
        try to take out the lead enemies first. Not only does this protect the truck, but it also fre- 
        quently leads to two or three-bike pile ups that clear the screen of opponents. 
        
        There are two kinds of opponents: red ones, and yellow ones. The red ones are quicker, 
        and can dodge your sword, so try to take them out by directly ramming them with your bike 
        (from the side, or by holding back when you're in front of them). This tactic isn't so effec- 
        tive with the yellow ones, but they're much more vulnerable to the sword, so come at them 
        from the side and start whacking. 
        
        Unlike most of the other games, you earn 10GP every 
        time you win at G-Bike, not just the first, so you can make 
        some pretty good money at this one. The first time you 
        win, you'll also get a Speed Source. 
        
        
        
        Hitting the head enemy first can lead 
        to many convenient two-in-one or 
        three-in-one bills as your first target 
        trips up his buddies.

        best time, represented as one of high ranking on the time trials, 
        two cute Mogs. (Time Trial only) 
        
        
        
        The snowboard mini-game, available after you play it for real in disc 
        2, features three all new courses, and a hidden time trial. It costs 
        only 200 gil to play, and you can continue as many times as you like! 
        
        To advance to courses B and C, you must score at least 70 points 
        on courses A and B, respectively. When tabulating your score, the 
        computer considers your time, your technique (it's fairly generous 
        in awarding points in these categories), and the number of balloons 
        you've picked up. The balloons are the trickiest part, as they're 
        worth 40 of each course's 100 points. The red ones are worth 1 
        point, the blue are worth 3, and the green are worth 5. If you're aim- 
        ing to master the course and win a prize (which requires scores 
        of 90+ points), you definitely can't afford to miss the blue and 
        greens. 
        
        Learn to steer mostly with the L and R, and don't take the 
        courses too fast... You'll lose far more points for missing bal- 
        loons than you will by going too slowly. If you get 70+ on each 
        of the three courses, a yellow balloon will appear near the start, 
        and touching it will take you to the obstacle-less time trial, 
        where you're ranked on your time. If you get a good enough 
        time (under 1'05" on Course A), a white balloon will appear, giv- 
        speed-boosting in 2 y° u tne turDO speed boost necessary to attain high ranks. 
        
        The prizes (for 90+ points) are: Course A: 30GP and a Safety 
        Bit, Course B: 100GP + Enemy-All Materia, Course C: 300GP and 
        a Crystal Bangle.

        ShOOtiflQ 60dSt6r Deep in Speed Square's metal tunnel lies the Shooting Coaster, far and

        things to be won here, but only true pros will get the minimum 5,000 points necessary to win them. 
        Luckily, Square provided a hidden little cheat for those who aren't quite up to the challenge. 
        
        One go at the Shooting Coaster costs 10 GP. There are prizes given away for scores of 3,000+, but 
        these are entirely worthless trinkets like a 1/35 scale Shinra soldier, a model of the Shinra Sweeper, 
        and a scale model of Sephiroth's Masamune. These exciting items have absolutely no use, and net you 
        no more than a crisp one dollar bill (or whatever form "Gil" comes in) when you try to sell them off. 
        
        The big prizes are at the 5,000+ mark. On disc 1, the prize is Aerith's silly weapon, the Umbrella. 
        From disc 2 on, the prize changes to Cid's powerful Flayer weapon. 
        
        There are two ways to go about achieving this score... One is to practice hard and mine the many 
        exciting bonuses that the programmers have hidden in the game. The other is to go for the big bonus 
        in the Zeppelin propeller (upper right), a bonus so huge that it makes your score flip a half-dozen 
        times and then ultimately glitch out. It's only when the ride's over that you get to see the size of the 
        bonus: About 30,000 points! leeyah! 
        
        Those who miss the zeppelin or want to rely on a more skilled method can follow some of the fol- 
        lowing strategies. One is to locate and hit the three hidden items: the giant rock, the steamboat pro- 
        peller, and the second-to-last light on the left. These are all listed on the right. These three together 
        will get you 600 points, a fairly sizeable bonus. The sparks in the cave with the icicles are also 
        extremely lucrative targets, netting 70 points each. Keep your aim level and towards the middle of 
        the screen, and sweep left to right for your best chance at hitting them. The icicles are easy hits, and 
        are worth 40 points each, making this one of the coaster's most lucrative areas. 
        
        If you want a practical chance at getting 5,000 points, you'll have to be very careful about your fir- 
        ing strategy. The game will fire automatically for you if you hold down the button, but this depletes 
        the bar on the left. As the bar goes down, your shots do less and less damage, leaving you unable to 
        successfully score on either the hidden or non-hidden targets. To win, you'll have to use the rapid 
        fire method, and either use a rapid fire controller, or hit the fire button as fast as your fingers can go. 
        Your rate of fire will be just as fast, and if your bar never dips below 10% empty or so, you'll also be 
        doing the maximum amount of damage. With proper application of this strategy, the final boss will 
        be a snap. If you can't beat him every time, then your firing tactics are simply not effective, and you'll 
        need to work on them before you can truly master the Shooting Coaster. 
        
        
        
        That 30,000+ ultra bonus is 
        right here. When the zep- 
        pelin appears, fire at its pro- 
        peller and never let up! If 
        you manage to hit it enough, 
        your score will go nuts. 
        
        
        
        
        ire strat- 
        egy correctly, the boss should 
        be fairly easy to beat. At 
        1,000 points, he's a very lucra- 
        tive target.

        Chocobo Racing is time consuming, 
        but you can win some decent items, or 
        i at least a ton of GP. 
        
        There are two ways to participate: One is 
        I to bet on the outcome of races, and the 
        
        I other is to breed a Chocobo and race your- 
        ( self. If you gamble, only the C and B ranks 
        I will be open to you until you start racing. 
        I When you bet, you should evaluate the six 
        [racers, and then pick the three that look 
        best, and bet on the three possible out- 
        I comes that have your three racers finishing 
        1 first and second. You get whatever prize is 
        I under the contingency you chose, making 
        I the prizes frustratingly random. The list of 
        I prizes, their GP value (if you chose to take 
        I that instead of the prize) and the leagues 
        | they can be won in is on the left. 
        
        If you race and come in first, you get the 
        'same prize you would have gotten if you 
        had bet on yourself and won. If you win on Rank S, eventually racing 
        champion loe will appear, and you'll have to race aga inst hi m. Bea t him 
        five times in a row, and Este will give 
        you the Sprint Shoes, the Power 
        Vest, the Choco Feather, and a 
        Counter Attack Materia! If you're 
        having trouble beating him, you can 
        use the hidden cheat: Hold R1&R2 as 
        you race to gradually refill to refill 
        your stamina bar! For instructions 
        on how to make winning Chocobos, 
        see page 98-99.

        The duel is fairly simple if your level is 
        high and you have the right equipment- 
        I recommend as many of the following as 
        you have: Ribbon, Escort Guard, Double 
        Cut, Counter Attach, Time, Enemy Skills, 
        HP Plus, and MP Plus. 
        The trick to the duel is not simply to 
        Bird Wing 1600 win, but to get all the battle points you 
        S. Mine 3200 can - This means tahing weak handicaps 
        
        early on (when they give you hardly any 
        battle points anyway), and then trying to 
        hit one of the really bad ones for your 
        final handicap. Luchily, the ones that 
        give you the most points aren't always 
        the ones that hurt you the most, so use 
        this to your advantage if you can. 
        
        When you have enough battle points 
        (remember, if you leave the Battle 
        Square, all your battle points vanish!), 
        get Cloud's level 4 limit break and the W- 
        Summon materia. Then, if you also have 
        Ultima Weapon, equip all three of these 
        Reagan Greens 2000 items and participate in the duel again... 
        
        You'll be allowed to enter a hidden sec- 
        ond Duel! The roster of enemies is pic- 
        tured on the right, and as you can see, 
        the final round pits Cloud, alone, against 
        Proud Clod. Basically the same strate- 
        gies work here, but you might want to 
        charge up your limit gauge before you 
        participate, so it'll be at full every time you start the duel. If 
        you have the Mimic materia, you can cheat hard, and simply 
        do your limit break, then Mimic it every other turn for an 
        easy victory. The prized Final Attack materia will be yours 
        in no time! Prizes for subsequent battles include Dio's 
        diaries, his autograph, and a Ribbon. 
        
        
        
        
        These guys tend to appear and cast 
        Slow on you early in Round 1, which 
        a Ribbon can't prevent. Make sure 
        you have Haste or Mighty Guard 
        spells on tap to counteract it, or it 
        will plague you for the remainder of

        Slots (level 2) 
        
        Cait Sith must kill eighty enemies to gain this limit break. 
        Cait Sith only has two limit breaks. The second. Slots, sort of 
        counts as multiple limit breaks because it has so many possi- 
        bly outcomes, but it does not change as you use it more, or 
        kill more enemies. Basically, you just spin the slots, and 
        something cool (usually) happens when you get three-of-a- 
        kind. Due to the general weakness of this limit break, and the 
        small but real possibility that you might get "Joker Death" as 
        the outcome, this is one of the weakest limit breaks in the 
        game. The random aspect may be fun, but I feel that it makes 
        Cait Sith the least effective of FFVII's playable characters. The 
        eight possible slot machine outcomes are listed on the right.

        Materia 
        
        
        
        In this section you'll find a list of all 82 materia that appear in 
        Final Fantasy VII. They're organized by color, and then sort 
        of by type and sort of in the order you get them... It all makes 
        sense in my mind, anyway. 
        
        The entries should be fairly self-explanatory (I hope), but I 
        just wanted to direct your attention to one thing: Note the 
        "sell" price listed for each materia. This is the amount of 
        money you can get for selling your Master-level materia, and 
        you'll notice that some of the prices, especially for Enemy- 
        All, which ticks in at well over a million gil, are incredibly 
        high. It's a great way to finance a Chocobo-racing habit!

        Grazy Materia Combos (part I ) 
        
        People frequently ask me, "Casey, is it pos- ^ — >v 
        
        sible to have more than one blue materia f \ f \ 
        working on any one green materia?" I J -|- I J 
        
        Actually, that's a lie. No one ever asks me N. J \^^J 
        anything about Final Fantasy VII I wish E A|| Lj htning 
        they would, so I could grab them firmly 
        by the shoulder and say, "YES, YES my 
        friend, you CAN!" 
        
        There's actually no limit to the amount 
        
        of linking materia you can use on any one \ / X ' 
        
        spell... The only limiting condition is MP Absorb Lightning 
        that you have to have many copies 
        of that green materia, all pretty 
        much at the same level. For exam- 
        ple, in the combo above, if the first | 
        Lightning was at master level, and 
        the second was just at level l, you 
        could use Bolt 3, and it would hit W 4 
        all enemies, but you would not 
        absorb MP from it. You could only j 
        hit all enemies and absorb MP if 
        you cast Bolt /, the only spell both 
        have in common. So using com- 
        bos like this tend to not be worth 
        the bother, because they require a 
        lot of duplicate materia and take up a lot of space. 
        
        But if you take the principle and carry it to the logical 
        extreme, you can do some wonderful things later on. It only 
        takes 2,000 AP to get the second level attack spell from the basic 
        attack materia, which is a snap later in the game, and even level 
        2 spells are devastatingly effective in the combo listed below. 
        And if you plan ahead and specialize in one type of attack mate- 
        _ ria early in the game (Although I used Fire in the example, 
        
        Lightning is probably the best, see the chart in the basic training 
        section), you might even have enough level 3 materia to make something like this work. 
        
        In the combo on the right, the principle is basically just to take one character and make him or her a 
        living materia combo, capable of only one basic action, but an action that does an obscene amount of 
        damage, steals from its targets, and completely refills the caster's MP and HP, over time. Sound useful? 
        You bet! 
        
        I chose Quadra Magic over Enemy-All for this one, because it allowed me to use fire and steal eight 
        times, (when Magic Quadra is at level 2) even though it won't target all creatures (Magic Quadra and 
        Enemy-All won't work together, so you'll have to chose one or the other). In practice, this beyond-evil 
        combo casts Fire 3 at random targets four times, pausing in between each blast to steal the target's sole 
        possession before they die and give the caster a nice little MP and HP bonus. At the end of the four 
        attacks, any surviving enemy gets nailed with one regular attack (you steal 4 times, but only attack 
        once), and then, thanks to the power of W-Magic, it happens all over again\ 8 Fire 3's, 8 steal attempts, 
        2 attacks, and the caster ends up with a lot more MP 
        than it cost to cast it in the first place. Sound good? 
        
        If you don't have enough space or enough dupli 
        cates of your attack spell, a lot of the parts of this x / 
        
        are optional. MP Turbo and Magic Plus add more 
        
        bite to your magic, which you probably don't Quadra Magic 
        need (I couldn't find a single group of enemies capa 
        ble of surviving the eight spells as it is), and HP 
        Absorb is kind of a lame materia all around, so you 
        can toss that one too, and still have a horribly effec- 
        tive combo capable of beating anyone or anything 
        in almost any situation! Magic Counter is just for 
        fun, since it allows you to launch into the combo 
        without even waiting for your turn to begin! Enjoy!

        While the magic, command, and independent materia are all fairly self-explanatory, the support materia will require a lot more 
        explanation, and a bit of experimentation on your part. While some of these little blue wonders really do just completely 
        suck, a handful of them rank among the most powerful Materia in the game. I encourage you to try them in a variety of differ- 
        ent combinations and situations. I've listed a few of my favorite combos in the coming pages, but there are a lot I simply did- 
        n't have space for, and I'm sure there are a lot of good combos that I'm not even aware of.

        Crazy Materia Combos (part 2) 
        
        
        
        The two most ridiculously powerful materia in the game are Final Attack and Quadra Magic. Final 
        Attach is probably the strongest, in that it lets you gain virtual immortality, as long as you don't run out 
        of Magic Points. 
        
        Despite the name, you'd have to be pretty dense to use Final Attach with an actual attack spell. 
        When enemies kill me, revenge is not the first thing on my mind... Springing back to life is. And a neat 
        little combo of Final Attack and Revive will ensure that if you ever go down, you'll come back- instant- 
        ly- with full HP and a lot of hard feelings. But an even cooler combo is Final Attack plus Phoenix. 
        Sure, it costs a bit more, but it's worth it! Not only does Phoenix bring you back from the grave, it 
        brings everyone else back with you. And even better, it does just enough damage to probably push 
        your killer over the brink of death himself, and odds are he won't have a neat combo like this to save 
        his life. As in the shots on the left, this combo allows you to perform stunning turnarounds and gives 
        you a great story to tell to your grandkids one day. 
        
        The appeal of Quadra Magic as an offensive spell is obvious. While it prevents 
        
        
        
        you from using Enemy-All, the ability to hit bosses with a spell like Ultima four 
        times in one turn for only 100 MP is pretty amazing. Probably the best Quadra 
        Magic combo is with the Contain magic. That Ultima trick is great, but if your

        Deathblow Added Cut 
        
        OG 
        
        Deathblow Added Steal 
        
        
        
        
        Of all the Command materia. 
        Deathblow is by far the easiest to 
        work with. The basic concept here is 
        that outside of combos, cool materia 
        like Added Cut and Added Steal are 
        usually wasted on materia you can't 
        use in every situation, lifee green 
        magic. But since Deathblow can be 
        used at any time, lifee the regular 
        attacfe option, it's ideal for combo- 
        making. 
        
        Deathblow + Added Cut is a 
        basic combo, but a very effective 
        one. Even if Deathblow causes 
        you to miss half the time, it does 
        double damage when it does hit, 
        so it averages out to being at least 
        as good as a regular attacfe. Add 
        Added Cut and you're attacking 
        twice in one turn! Just like 
        Double Cut, except you can get 
        this combo working much earlier 
        in the game... In some ways it's 
        actually better, too, because if the 
        first hit kills one opponent, the 
        second attack will go for a new target, and not be wasted like it 
        is with Double Cut. 
        
        The same principle works with Added Steal... If you use 
        Deathblow every turn, you can steal every turn. Best of all, 
        since you can just buy a second Deathblow, and its ability is 
        active right out of the box, so to speak, it's great for linking up 
        multiple blue materia. If you can spare four slots, link Added 
        Cut and Added Steal and attack twice and steal every turn! If 
        you have even more slots, you can add the combo below, too. 
        
        This second combo isn't very, uh, "crazy," I suppose, but it's 
        worth talking about. A lot of people assume that blue materia 
        will only work with spell and summon materia, which is com- 
        
        — -\ * >. pletely wrong. As you can see, most of 
        
        f A f A them also work on Command materia, 
        P J -|- I J allowing combos like the one on the 
        
        N / \^ y left. Since Deathblow naturally does a 
        
        MP Absorb Deathblow Iot of damage, and is useful by itself, 
        . you might want to stick an MP 
        Absorb (or even HP Absorb) to it if 
        you have the space. It's a good 
        way to pick up a Iot of extra MP 
        quickly, and since it can be used 
        with the combo above, anyone 
        with 40,000 gil can buy four 
        I Deathblow materia and end up 
        attacking twice, and gaining both 
        HP and MP at the end. Why not 
        buy a few more Deathblows and 
        toss in a Command Counter, or a 
        Sneak attacfe? The sfey's the limit 
        with this flexible materia.

        If this succeeds, the target enemy turns green and

        Crazy Materia Combos (part 4) 
        
        j Here's an independent materia-based combo that's good-natured fun for 
        the whole family. Simply pick your strongest character and load him up 
        with every counter item you have. You have to start planning for this 
        one early, and raise lots of Counter Attach materia, then stich the lucky 
        winner with all of those, plus Command Counter and Magic Counter Magic Counter

        character takes every hit the enemies launch, no matter who it targets. V J "T" y J 
        
        And every time your chosen gets hit, the attacfeer gets himself, as my 
        
        uncle Nelson used to say, "a bucket full of whoop-ass." This strategy is Cmnd. Counter 
        incredibly effective, but you'll find that whoever gets stuck bearing the 
        burden won't last long. So give him your best armor, a Ribbon, and as 
        many HP Plusses as you can spare. If you have a Final Attack + Revive 
        combo going, that's the perfect addition. To ensure he doesn't run out of 
        MP (if you're using Magic Counter), get a copy of whatever materia is Counter Attack 
        in the Magic Counter and stick it to an MP Absorb... Comet works nice- (as many as 
        ly, since Comet 2 does lots of damage and hits all targets. you got!) 
        
        The results are on the left... The Behemoth attacks, and gets himself 
        stuck with three regular attacks, one critical attack (courtesy of the Deathblow 
        hooked up to Command Counter) and a whole ton of meteors... One of the game's 
        most powerful enemies is killed in one stroke, and none of our guys have even had 
        their turns yet! The possibilities here are endless. Send your Counter'ing fighter 
        
        against bosses and 
        just walk away, con- 
        fident in the knowledge that 
        your foe will be smitten by the 
        time you get back, even if you 
        don't actually do anything. A 
        dirty, dirty combo.

        the game. You can only get this

        and can not reproduce itself. 
        
        
        
        Crazy Materia Combos (part 5) 
        
        Summon Materia may not seem like a nat- /" "N. 
        ural choice for combos, but there are a L . 
        few hidden tricks to using them. The first T J I 
        one involves the otherwise sad, sad linking\^_^ 
        materia "Added Effect." This materia Added Effect Cnoco/Mo 9 
        sounds good in theory, allowing you to or Hades 
        
        stick enemies with nasty conditions by just using your weapon, 
        so you no longer have to waste a turn (or MP) casting spells 
        that'll probably just miss anyway. In practice, though, it kind of sucks. Early in the game it's hard to 
        waste two materia slots to get this working (it's a waste of two materia slots because no one in their 
        right mind would ever use a non-Enemy-AU'ed "Transform" or "Mystify" or whatever in an actual bat- 
        tle), and late in the game no one wants to waste time with lame conditions like "Sleep." 
        
        Believe it or not, two Red Materia are able to provide a solution... Since Choco/Mog casts Stop on 
        enemies sometimes, it'll give that same effect to your weapon if linked with an Added Effect. Not only 
        is Stop one of the few really useful conditional spells, but you can start using it without having to save 
        up any AP! Even better, you're not wasting any materia slots since summon spells are useful in and of 
        
        .^w^. themselves! Later in the game, Hades makes an even better choice, since that 
        
        I nasty fellow can stick enemies with any of his seven nasty conditions, and is a 
        
        pf- j -L- Mr* capable summon spell himself. No doubt about it-These Red Data Animals are 
        
        V J V J capable of making even lame blue linkers like Added Effect work for >you!< 
        
        MP Absorb Alexander Another support materia, MP Absorb also works great with call spells... This 
        linking materia is only viable when linked with materia capable of doing 
        massive amounts of damage for little MP. Alexander works best, since he 
        does an obscene amount of damage and can be gained relatively early on. 
        Use him against groups of three or more, and all the overkill damage he 
        dishes out will ensure that you end up making back more MP than it took 
        to cast him! In areas where enemies tend to travel in large groups, you 
        can use him every single turn, making areas like Ice Gate a breeze!

        For your perusing convenience, Versus Boobs proudly presents this exciting, special, Enemy Skills version of the Final Fantasy VII 
        world map, with at least one location of each enemy shill labeled. Once again, I'd like to reiterate that this is being presented for 
        your perusing convenience, and not simply because I couldn't think of anything else to do with the bottom half of this page. I just 
        want to make absolutely sure that we're clear about this. Again, this is for your, uh, "perusing convenience." Got it? Good. Enjoy!
